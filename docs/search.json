When attention is given, the focus tends to be on student activism, access to higher education, or curriculum development. The experiences of academics affected by conflict remain under-researched, despite the crucial role they play as educators and in generating, documenting, preserving and challenging knowledges. This is particularly concerning given that academics have−and continue to be−at risk as targets of sanction, persecution and oppression."

Drawing on public and private archives, it reveals the untold stories of the women serving in the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), balancing their wartime contributions with the strictures of secrecy and censorship. The narrative is framed by letters from these Wrens, which provide intimate glimpses into both the personal and professional challenges they faced during World War II.\n\n\nGenetic Narratology: Analysing Narrative across Versions\n\nEditor: Dirk Van Hulle\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0426\nGenetic Narratology is the first full-length volume to merge genetic criticism with narratology, offering an innovative approach to understanding literature.

It challenges the biases and prejudices inherent within uninformed histories of mathematics, including problems of white supremacy, the denial of cultural difference and the global homogenization of teaching methods. In particular, the book contrasts the effectiveness of mathematics and science in modelling physical phenomena and solving technical problems with its ineffectiveness in modelling social phenomena and solving human problems, and urges us to consider how mathematics might better meet the urgent crises of our age.\n\n\nInvesting in the Structural Transformation: 2024 European Public Investment Outlook\n\nEditor: Floriana Cerniglia\nEditor: Francesco Saraceno\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0434\nThe fifth volume in the European Public Investment Outlook series explores how Europe can drive structural transformation through strategic public investment.

This means that what one knows is influenced not just by belief, evidence, and truth, but crucially by the purposes those beliefs serve. Drawing from classical Nyāya epistemologies, the book asserts that knowledge rationalizes action: if you know something, it is sensible to act on it—and the best way to square this with an anti-sceptical epistemology is to say that knowledge is interest-relative.\n\n\nBurning Diagrams in Anthropology: An Inverse Museum\n\nAuthor: Tristan Partridge\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0468.1.00\n\n\nNo Prices No Games!: Four Economic Models\n\nAuthor: Michael Richter\nAuthor: Ariel Rubinstein\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0438\nWhile current economic theory focuses on prices and games, this book models economic settings where harmony is established through one of the following societal conventions:\n• A power relation according to which stronger agents are able to force weaker ones to do things against their will. • A norm that categorizes actions as permissible or forbidden. • A status relation over alternatives which limits each agent’s choices. • Systematic biases in agents’ preferences.\nThese four conventions are analysed using simple and mathematically straightforward models, without any pretensions regarding direct applied usefulness. While we do not advocate for the adoption of any of these conventions specifically – we do advocate that when modelling an economic situation, alternative equilibrium notions should be considered, rather than automatically reaching for the familiar approaches of prices or games.\n\n\nDiachronic Diversity in Classical Biblical Hebrew\n\nAuthor: Aaron D. Hornkohl\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0433\nAccording to the standard periodisation of ancient Hebrew, the division of Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the Masoretic tradition is basically dichotomous: pre-exilic Classical Biblical Hebrew (CBH) versus post-Restoration Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH). Within this paradigm, the chronolectal unity of CBH is rarely questioned—this despite the reasonable expectation that the language of a corpus encompassing traditions of various ages and comprising works composed, edited, and transmitted over the course of centuries would show signs of diachronic development. From the perspective of historical evolution, CBH is remarkably homogenous. Within this apparent uniformity, however, there are indeed signs of historical development, sets of alternant features whose respective concentrations seem to divide CBH into two sub-chronolects. The most conspicuous typological division that emerges is between the CBH of the Pentateuch and that of the relevant Prophets and Writings. The present volume investigates a series of features that distinguish the two ostensible CBH sub-chronolects, weighs alternative explanations for distribution patterns that appear to have chronological significance, and considers broader implications for Hebrew diachrony and periodisation and for the composition of the Torah.\n\n\nDigital Humanities in the India Rim: Contemporary Scholarship in Australia and India\n\nEditor: Myra Gurney\nEditor: Hart Cohen\nEditor: Ujjwal Jana\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0423\nThis varied collection delves into illuminating examples of Digital Humanities research and practice currently being undertaken by academics in India and Australia, and seeks to understand the shared challenges as well as the points of similarity and difference between them. From the influence of Netflix on International Relations to contemporary digital adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, via detours into erobotics (empathic robots) and the cultural specificity of online dating, these essays convey the distinctive breadth and imagination of research in this field.\nDigital Humanities is a relatively new discipline in the India Rim, and this novelty has created space for innovative research ideas, as well as the use of traditional methodologies and software in different ways within these unique cultural spaces that could potentially influence how Digital Humanities is conceptualised internationally.\n\n\nOblation: Essays, Parables, Paradoxes\n\nAuthor: M.H.

The classic example of this fallacy, the first of Aristotle’s fallacies independent of language, is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know Coriscus, Coriscus is the one approaching, but you don’t know the one approaching since, e.g., he is wearing a mask. But Aristotle’s account is unclear and Segrave, building on ideas of Giles of Rome and Walter Burley, shows how the fallacy turns on an equivocation over the supposition of the middle term or one of the extremes in a syllogism. Thereby, Segrave is able to counter Bradwardine’s arguments one by one and defend the restrictivist solution. In this volume, Segrave’s text is edited from the three extant manuscripts, is translated into English, and is preceded by a substantial Introduction.\n\n\nDiversity across the Arabian Peninsula: Language, Culture, Nature\n\nEditor: Fabio Gasparini\nEditor: Kamala Russell\nEditor: Janet C.E.

This edited volume delves into why modern philosophical approaches to technology closely align with phenomenology and explores the implications of this relationship. Over the past two decades, scholars have emphasized users’ lived experiences and their interactions with technological practices, arguing that technologies gain meaning and shape within specific contexts, actively shaping those contexts in return. This book investigates the phenomenological roots of contemporary philosophy of technology, examining how phenomenology informs analyses of temporality, use, cognition, embodiment, and environmentality. Divided into three sections, the volume begins by exploring the role of phenomenological methods in the philosophy of technology, and further investigates the methodological implications of combining phenomenology with other philosophical schools. The second section examines technology as a phenomenon, debating whether it should be analysed as a whole or through individual artifacts. The final section addresses the practical applications of phenomenological insights in design practices and democratic engagement.\n\n\nThe Ruins of Solitude: Maternity at the Limits of Academic Discourse\n\nAuthor: Lette Bragg\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0473.1.00\n\n\nGrotesque and Performance in the Art of Aubrey Beardsley\n\nAuthor: Evanghelia Stead\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0413\nThis insightful study illuminates previously unexplored aspects of Aubrey Beardsley’s relationship to the grotesque and his use of media, particularly his manipulation of the periodical press. For the first time and with keen intelligence, Evanghelia Stead fully reveals the aesthetic importance of Beardsley’s Bon-Mots vignettes, as well as the relationship between Darwinism, his innovative foetus motif, and Decadence itself.\n\n\nMeta-Xenakis: New Perspectives on Iannis Xenakis’s Life, Work, and Legacies\n\nEditor: Sharon Kanach\nEditor: Peter Nelson\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0390\nMeta-Xenakis offers readers a comprehensive collection of insights into the history, works and legacy of Iannis Xenakis, one of the twentieth century’s most significant creative figures.

This has shifted government funding and support towards the urban areas leaving rural areas destitute.\nIn State Power in Land Reform, the author relies on a robust theoretical frame, extensive policy analysis and empirical data to advocate for a new engagement with local communities through rejuvenated municipalities, that is, through strong local institutions.\nState Power in Land Reform provides a valuable analytical account for both the historian and the archive.\n\n\nThe Dream-Slaves\n\nAuthor: Darieck Scott\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0399.1.00\n\n\nUrban Heritage and Sustainability in the Age of Globalisation\n\nEditor: Lilia Makhloufi\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0412\nThis book offers a deep exploration of architectural and urban heritage, using interdisciplinary and intercultural approaches to assess how historical, social, economic and political factors have impacted heritage development and its sustainability.

The book delves into the evolving roles of these universities, examining how they navigate their responsibilities at national, international and local levels.\nThe book uncovers the tensions between global aspirations, national relevance and local realities. In doing so, this insightful work sheds light on the unique challenges and opportunities faced by African flagship universities, revealing their potential as forces for local, national and international collaboration and development.\nRevisiting Africa’s Flagship Universities provides rigorous evidence on the relevance of higher education at the local and national level, and the interrelation between these and the burgeoning international roles of universities. This book makes for important reading for university staff, policymakers, and anyone interested in the future of higher education in Africa.\n\n\nThe Verb in Classical Hebrew: The Linguistic Reality behind the Consecutive Tenses\n\nAuthor: Bo Isaksson\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0414\nThe consecutive tenses are fundamental in all descriptions of Classical Hebrew grammar. They are even basic to the textbooks on Biblical Hebrew. Being fundamental in the verbal system, and part of any beginner’s grammar, they pose a serious problem to a linguistic understanding of the verbal system, since grammars describe an alternation of ‘forms’ or ‘tenses’ in double pairs: wayyiqṭol alternates with its ‘equivalent’ qaṭal, and wə-qaṭal alternates with its ‘equivalent’ yiqṭol. This ‘enigma’ in the verbal system is handled in the book by recognising that the alternation of the consecutive tenses with other tenses, in the reality of the text, represents a linking of clauses. The ‘consecutive tenses’ are clause-types with a natural language connective wa- directly followed by a finite verbal morpheme, a type of clause that expressed continuity in the earliest stage of Semitic. The commonly held assumption that there is a special ‘consecutive waw’ is unwarranted. The use of the ‘consecutive’ clause-types in order to express discourse continuity indicates that Classical Hebrew has retained the old unmarked declarative word order of Semitic syntax. Seen in the light of recent research on the Tiberian reading tradition, the ‘consecutive’ wayyiqṭol can be analysed as a retention of the old Semitic past perfective *wa-yaqtul, which was pronounced wa-yiqṭol in Classical Hebrew. The ‘consecutive’ wə-qāṭal (pronounced wa-qaṭal in the classical language) constitutes the result of an internal Hebrew development into a construction (in the sense of Joan Bybee) already foreshadowed in the earliest Northwest Semitic languages. The book understands the ‘consecutive tenses’ as discourse continuity clauses, which typically form chains of main line clauses. Such chains can be interrupted by other types of clauses. This interruption is a clause linking that receives special attention in the interpretation of the Classical Hebrew verbal system. Chapter six presents a regenerated text linguistics founded on the new terminology.\n\n\nThe Last Years of Polish Jewry: Volume 2: The Permanent Pogrom, 1935–37\n\nAuthor: Yankev Leshchinsky\nEditor: Robert Brym\nTranslator: Eli Jany\nTranslator: Robert Brym\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0342\nUkrainian-born Yankev Leshchinsky (1876-1966) was the leading scholarly and journalistic analyst of Eastern European Jewish socioeconomic and political life from the 1920s to the 1950s. Known as “the dean of Jewish sociologists” and “the father of Jewish demography,” Leshchinsky published a series of insightful and moving essays in Yiddish on Polish Jewry between 1927 and 1937. Despite heightened interest in interwar Jewish communities in Poland in recent years, these essays (like most of Leshchinsky’s works) have never been translated into English.\n\n\nboy says: (a book with no ending)\n\nAuthor: Néstor Ponce\nTranslator: Max Ubelaker Andrade\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0528.1.00\n\n\nTouching Parchment: How Medieval Users Rubbed, Handled, and Kissed Their Manuscripts: Volume 2: Social Encounters with the Book\n\nAuthor: Kathryn M. Rudy\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0379\nIn the late middle ages (ca. 1200-1520), both religious and secular people used manuscripts, was regarded as a most precious item.

But what does this phrase actually entail, and what is its relevance today? How do citizens themselves experience, feel and respond to this ‘crisis’? Bitter-Sweet Democracy grapples with the complexities of these questions in the context of citizens’ relations to politics in Belgium—a nation that has experienced political instability and protests as well as social mobilization and democratic vitality in recent years.\n\n\nAugustus De Morgan, Polymath: New Perspectives on his Life and Legacy\n\nAuthor: Karen Attar\nAuthor: Adrian Rice\nAuthor: Christopher Stray\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0408\nWhen Augustus De Morgan died in 1871, he was described as ‘one of the profoundest mathematicians in the United Kingdom’ and even as ‘the greatest of our mathematicians’. But he was far more than just a mathematician. Because much of his voluminous written output on various subjects was scattered throughout journals and encyclopaedias, the breadth of his interests and contributions has been underappreciated by historians. Now, renewed interest in De Morgan’s life and work has coincided with the digitization of his extensive library, revealing the extent to which he pioneered and influenced the development of not merely mathematics but also logic, astronomy, the history of mathematics, education, and bibliography.\n\n\nTrix: The Other Kipling\n\nAuthor: Barbara Fisher\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0377\nThis volume represents the first biography of Alice MacDonald Kipling Fleming (1868-1948), known as Trix. Rarely portrayed with sympathy or accuracy in biographies of her famous brother Rudyard, Trix was a talented writer and a memorable character in her own right whose fascinating life was unknown until now. In telling Trix’s story, Barbara Fisher rescues her from the misrepresentations, trivializations, and outright neglect of Rudyard’s many biographers.\n\n\nAn Anthology of Global Risk\n\nEditor: SJ Beard\nEditor: Tom Hobson\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0360\nThis anthology brings together a diversity of key texts in the emerging field of Existential Risk Studies. It serves to complement the previous volume The Era of Global Risk: An Introduction to Existential Risk Studies by providing open access to original research and insights in this rapidly evolving field. At its heart, this book highlights the ongoing development of new academic paradigms and theories of change that have emerged from a community of researchers in and around the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. The chapters in this book challenge received notions of human extinction and civilization collapse and seek to chart new paths towards existential security and hope."

Moreover, it is argued that the techniques for adapting epic into theater could have been Greco-Roman influences in India, and that some of the elements adapted within the literary motifs (specifically the motifs of the embassy, the ambush, and the ogre) could have been Greco-Roman borrowings by Sanskrit authors.\n\n\nAn Annotated Corpus of Three Hundred Proverbs, Sayings, and Idioms in Eastern Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t\n\nAuthor: Giuliano Castagna\nContributions by: Suhail al-Amri\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0422\nThis book explores the rich paremiological heritage of Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t, an endangered pre-literate language belonging to the Modern South Arabian sub-branch of Semitic, spoken by an ever-decreasing number of people in the Dhofar governorate of the Sultanate of Oman.\n\n\nNight-sky: Vol. 2\n\nEditor: Mehita Iqani\nEditor: Wamuwi Mbao\nCape Town: African Minds, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502920\nWhat is science communication? This collection proposes that it can be creative writing aimed at the heart, rather than information directed to the mind.\nFicSci playfully subverts the term ‘science fiction’ to offer an experimental process that explores the limits of imagination in relation to scientific possibility (and vice versa). FicSci is an experiment in hybridized creative practice that induces new forms of knowledge-making between the hard sciences and the social world. This collection offers writing that emerged from an encounter that brought twelve creative writers together with an astronomer.\nThe presented science invited contemplation of scientific aspects of the night sky, in specific X-ray binary stars, extra-galactic sources, and magellanic clouds. The creative writings that emerged are attendant to the wider potentialities of scientific thought, and reveal how methodologies for storying the scientific encounter are creatively multi-form.\n\n\nThinking Blue / Writing Red: Marxism and the (Post)Human\n\nAuthor: Stephen Tumino\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0324\nThinking Blue/Writing Red interrogates contemporary culture across a range of texts, from the pandemic (‘Covid’ and ‘Trump Speak’) to high theory (Melville’s narratives) and popular culture (Beyoncé’s ‘Formation’ and Super Bowl performance, Twin Peaks , metamodern ‘cli-fi’ films).\n\n\nTaunting the Useful\n\nAuthor: Loumille Métros\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0449.1.00\n\n\nEtosha Pan to the Skeleton Coast: Conservation Histories, Policies and Practices in North-west Namibia\n\nEditor: Sian Sullivan\nEditor: Ute Dieckmann\nEditor: Selma Lendelvo\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0402\nEtosha Pan to the Skeleton Coast examines the conservation histories and concerns of one of southern Africa’s most iconic conservation regions: the variously connected ‘Etosha-Kunene’ areas of north-central and north-west Namibia. This cross-disciplinary volume brings together contributions from a Namibian and international group of scholars and conservation practitioners, working on topics ranging from colonial histories to water management, perceptions of ‘wildlife’ and the politics of belonging. Together, these essays confront a critical question: how can the conservation of biodiversity-rich landscapes be reconciled with historical injustices of social exclusion and marginalisation?\n\n\nVoices from Nubia: Critical Essays on Contemporary Nubian Literature from Egypt\n\nEditor: Mona M.

Since their establishment as scientific tools for classification in the eighteenth century, diagrams have been used to determine but also to deny kinship between human groups. In nineteenth-century craniometry, they were omnipresent in attempts to standardize measurements on skulls for hierarchical categorization. In particular the ’human family tree’ was central for evolutionary understandings of human diversity, being used on both sides of debates about whether humans constitute different species well into the twentieth century. With recent advances in (ancient) DNA analyses, the tree diagram has become more contested than ever―does human relatedness take the shape of a network? Are human individual genomes mosaics made up of different ancestries? Sommer examines the epistemic and political role of these visual representations in the history of ‘race’ as an anthropological category. How do such diagrams relate to imperial and (post-)colonial practices and ideologies but also to liberal and humanist concerns?\n\n\nContainment: Technologies of Holding, Filtering, Leaking\n\nAuthor: Daniela Agostinho\nAuthor: Hélène Frichot\nAuthor: Meredith Jones\nAuthor: Chris Otter\nAuthor: Paul Graham Raven\nAuthor: Helen Runting\nAuthor: Yolande Strengers\nAuthor: Nanna Bonde Thylstrup\nAuthor: Dinesh Wadiwel\nEditor: Zoë Sofoulis\nEditor: Marie-Luise Angerer\nEditor: Ingrid Richardson\nEditor: Hannah Schmedes\nLüneburg: meson press, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/2188\nContainers are ubiquitous and inescapable. From handbags to houses, barrels to databases, captivating gameworlds to the “bag of stars” that Ursula Le Guin calls the universe, containers furnish infrastructures for living and action while extending our capacities for managing things across space and time. They not only give shape to our lifeworlds: they form and transform our bodies and being.\nThe chapters in Containment: Technologies of Holding, Filtering, Leaking traverse technologies, bodies, ontologies and imaginaries, reflecting on what different container technologies, containment strategies, and container metaphors tell us about ourselves and how we relate to our worlds. With common reference to Zoë Sofia’s (2000) foundational essay on container technologies, contributors draw on media and cultural studies, social history, architecture, and postdualistic approaches in philosophy and social science to explore liminalities of containment both as and beyond holding.\n\n\nAtlas of Petromodernity\n\nAuthor: Alexander Klose\nAuthor: Benjamin Steininger\nTranslator: Ayça Türkoğlu\nForeword by: Stephanie LeMenager\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0514.1.00"

Based on ten years of research in archives across the world and drawing on sources in multiple languages, this masterful biography explores how Feliks Volkhovskii’s life illuminates broader intellectual and historical questions about the Russian revolutionary movement. It is essential reading for anyone interested in late Imperial Russia and the Russian revolution.\n\n\nMusic and Spirituality: Theological Approaches, Empirical Methods, and Christian Worship\n\nEditor: George Corbett\nEditor: Sarah Moerman\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0403\nThe composer Sir James MacMillan has often referred to music as ‘the most spiritual of the arts’, and for many people, regardless of religious affiliation, this rings true. In listening to music, we are drawn to dimensions of human experience beyond the material. This collection brings together leading scholars from various disciplines – including Christian theology, musicology, and psychology and neuroscience – to interrogate the intimate relationship between music and spirituality.\n\n\nWilhelm Reich versus the Flying Saucers: An American Tragedy\n\nAuthor: James Reich\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0452.1.00\n\n\nAntisemitism in Online Communication: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Hate Speech in the Twenty-First Century\n\nEditor: Laura Ascone\nEditor: Karolina Placzynta\nEditor: Chloé Vincent\nEditor: Matthias J. Becker\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0406\nDrawing from disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, semiotics, history, and philosophy, this edited collection examines over 100,000 user comments from three language communities. Contributors explore various facets of online antisemitism, including its intersectionality with misogyny and its dissemination through memes and social networks. Through case studies, they examine the reproduction, support, and rejection of antisemitic tropes, alongside quantitative assessments of comment structures in online discussions. Additionally, the volume delves into the capabilities of content moderation tools and deep-learning models for automated hate speech detection. This multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive understanding of contemporary antisemitism in digital spaces, recognising the importance of addressing its insidious spread from multiple angles.\n\n\nThe Life of Nuns: Love, Politics, and Religion in Medieval German Convents\n\nAuthor: Eva Schlotheuber\nAuthor: Henrike Lähnemann\nTranslator: Anne Simon\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0397\nIn the Middle Ages half of those who chose the religious life were women, yet historians have overlooked entire generations of educated, feisty, capable and enterprising nuns, condemning them to the dusty silence of the archives. What, though, were their motives for entering a convent and what was their daily routine behind its walls like? How did they think, live and worship, both as individuals and as a community? How did they maintain contact with the families and communities they had left behind? Henrike Lähnemann and Eva Schlotheuber offer readers a vivid insight into the largely unknown lives and work of religious women in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\n\nPsychological Perspectives on Musical Experiences and Skills: Research in the Western Balkans and Western Europe\n\nEditor: Blanka Bogunović\nEditor: Renee Timmers\nEditor: Sanela Nikolić\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0389\nThis book features recent research on the psychology of music from the Western Balkans, foregrounding its specific topics, methods, and influences by bringing it into productive conversation with complementary research from Western Europe and further afield.\n\n\nThe Presence of Absence: Meditations on the Unsayable in Writing\n\nAuthor: Katina L.

Munro): Original and Uncollected Stories\n\nEditor: Bruce Gaston\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0365\nThe short stories of Hector Hugh Munro, better known by his pen name Saki, have remained in print continuously for over a hundred years. This collection is the first of its kind to present his stories as they were originally published in newspapers and magazines, preserving their internal consistency and contemporary references lost in revisions for The Chronicles of Clovis and subsequent collected editions. A trove of annotations and carefully sourced bibliographical information illuminates the Edwardian context behind the thirteen selected stories, of which three (‘Mrs. Pendercoet’s Lost Identity’, ‘The Romance of Business’ and ‘The Optimist’) were only recently rediscovered."

Als Neuverortung im Spannungsfeld medienökologischer, neomaterialistischer und technikfeministischer Theoriebildung werden hier all jene Widerständigkeiten und Un/Verfügbarkeiten sondiert, die von techno-kapitalistisch protegierten Operationen nicht zu tilgen sind. Was hieße es, die planetarische Implikation der Technosphäre aus Mikroperspektiven zu denken, mit ihren Überlappungen, Leerstellen, Fragmentierungen, Akkumulationen des Technischen zu schreiben? Entlang ihrer materiellen Prozessualität werden elementare Medien wie Regen, Minerale, Staub und Schaum zur Gegenwartsdiagnose. Angesichts der umfassenden Ökologisierungstendenzen und ihrer experimentellen Verarbeitung in Medienkunst und Interfacedesign verdichtet sich ein kritisches Begriffsinventar, das die makrologische Karriere des Technischen anders denkt.\n\n\nRoles and Relations in Biblical Law: A Study of Participant Tracking, Semantic Roles, and Social Networks in Leviticus 17-26\n\nAuthor: Christian Canu Højgaard\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0376\nLeviticus 17–26, an ancient law text known as the Holiness Code, prescribes how particular persons are to behave in concrete, everyday situations. The addressees of the law text must revere their parents, respect the elderly, fear God, take care of their fellow, provide for the sojourner, and so on. The sojourner has his own obligations, as do the priests. Even God is said to behave in various ways towards various persons. Thus, the law text forms an intricate web of persons and interactions.\n\n\nMusic and the Making of Modern Japan: Joining the Global Concert\n\nAuthor: Margaret Mehl\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0374\nIn only 50 years, from the 1870s to the early 1920s, Japanese people laid the foundations for the country’s post-war rise as a musical as well as an economic power. Meanwhile, new types of popular song, fuelled by the growing global record industry, successfully blended inspiration from the West with musical characteristics perceived as Japanese.\n\n\nSpeaking with the Dead: An Ethnography of Extrahuman Experience\n\nAuthor: Matt Tomlinson\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0465.1.00\n\n\nTeaching Music Performance in Higher Education: Exploring the Potential of Artistic Research\n\nEditor: Gilvano Dalagna\nEditor: Stefan Östersjö\nEditor: Helen Julia Minors\nEditor: Jorge Salgado Correia\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0398\nThis book contributes presenting examples of artistic research projects that are embedded within Higher Music Performance courses at universities and conservatoires across Europe.\n\n\nDemocratic Algorithms: Ethnography of a Public Recommender System\n\nAuthor: Nikolaus Poechhacker\nLüneburg: meson press, 2024\nCan an algorithm be democratic? And how can we understand algorithms not only as technical, but also as social and political phenomena? Democratic Algorithms offers theoretically and empirically informed perspectives on how we can imagine and design algorithms for a democratic society, and what we even mean by that. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, the book illustrates how a recommender system was built in a public broadcaster, raising questions not only about organizational and technical implementation, but also about the possible compatibility of such an algorithmic system with democratic constitutions.\n\n\nTacit Cinematic Knowledge: Approaches and Practices\n\nAuthor: Haritha R.\nAuthor: Claire Salles\nAuthor: Felix M.

In these places and institutions film and moving image technologies serve to advance knowledge, to show how things are done, to train, teach, educate, mobilize people, as well as to imagine complex social facts and visualize dynamic models and schemes through data visualizations, pattern recognition software, and in social graphs. But what these moving images do goes beyond instruction, illustration and visual education. This publication introduces the concept of tacit cinematic knowledge to designate a broad variety of epistemic environments in which knowledge is configured in and through cinematic practices, and in the interaction with moving images. The concept thus describes a challenge not only for film and media scholars, but also for social scientists, economists, data analysts and artists.\nCovering areas of study beyond the cinema and non-theatrical films which have recently become a focus of inquiry, the contributions analyze the operations of tacit cinematic knowledge in objects ranging from political campaigns, medical and scientific devices, corporate communications, devices for the study of animal behavior and more.\n\n\nOntohackers: Radical Movement Philosophy in the Age of Extinctions and Algorithms, Part I: Radical Movement Philosophy and the Body Intelligence R/evolution\n\nAuthor: Jaym*/Jaime del Val\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0402.1.00\n\n\nOn the Trail of the Morning Star: Psychosis as Self-Discovery\n\nAuthor: Dorothea Buck\nEditor: Susanne Antonetta\nTranslator: Eva Lipton\nForeword by: Hans Krieger\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0462.1.00\n\n\nLividity\n\nAuthor: Kim Rosenfield\nIntroduction by: Trisha Low\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0511.1.00\n\n\nReign of the Beast: The Atheist World of W. D. Saull and his Museum of Evolution\n\nAuthor: Adrian Desmond\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0393\nIn the 1830s, decades before Darwin published the Origin of Species, a museum of evolution flourished in London. Reign of the Beast pieces together the extraordinary story of this lost working-man’s institution and its enigmatic owner, the wine merchant W. D. Saull. A financial backer of the anti-clerical Richard Carlile, the ‘Devil’s Chaplain’ Robert Taylor, and socialist Robert Owen, Saull outraged polite society by putting humanity’s ape ancestry on display. He weaponized his museum fossils and empowered artisans with a knowledge of deep geological time that undermined the Creationist base of the Anglican state. His geology museum, called the biggest in Britain, housed over 20,000 fossils, including famous dinosaurs. Saull was indicted for blasphemy and reviled during his lifetime. After his death in 1855, his museum was demolished and he was expunged from the collective memory. Now multi-award-winning author Adrian Desmond undertakes a thorough reading of Home Office spy reports and subversive street prints to re-establish Saull’s pivotal place at the intersection of the history of geology, atheism, socialism, and working-class radicalism.\n\n\nArabic Documents from Medieval Nubia\n\nAuthor: Geoffrey Khan\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0391\nThis volume presents an edition of a corpus of Arabic documents data-ble to the 11th and 12th centuries AD that were discovered by the Egypt Exploration Society at the site of the Nubian fortress Qaṣr Ibrīm (situated in the south of modern Egypt).\n\n\nJesus and the Making of the Modern Mind, 1380-1520\n\nAuthor: Luke Clossey\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0371\nFor his fifteenth-century followers, Jesus was everywhere – from baptism to bloodcults to bowling. This sweeping and unconventional investigation looks at Jesus across one hundred forty years of social, cultural, and intellectual history. Mystics married him, Renaissance artists painted him in three dimensions, Muslim poets praised his life-giving breath, and Christopher (“Christ-bearing”) Columbus brought the symbol of his cross to the Americas. Beyond the European periphery, this global study follows Jesus across – and sometimes between – religious boundaries, from Greenland to Kongo to China."

One of the most significant dances in Europe, with a strong symbolic significance in western dance culture and dance scholarship, the minuet has evolved a distinctive pathway in this region, which these rigorous and pioneering essays explore.\n\n\n(An)Archive: Childhood, Memory, and the Cold War\n\nEditor: Mnemo ZIN\nEditor: Iveta Silova\nEditor: Nelli Piattoeva\nEditor: Zsuzsa Millei\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0383\nWhat was it like growing up during the Cold War? What can childhood memories tell us about state socialism and its aftermath? How can these intimate memories complicate history and redefine possible futures? These questions are at the heart of the (An)Archive: Childhood, Memory, and the Cold War. This edited collection stems from a collaboration between academics and artists who came together to collectively remember their own experiences of growing up on both sides of the ‘Iron Curtain’. Looking beyond official historical archives, the book gathers memories that have been erased or forgotten, delegitimized or essentialized, or, at best, reinterpreted nostalgically within the dominant frameworks of the East-West divide. And it reassembles and (re)stores these childhood memories in a form of an ‘anarchive’: a site for merging, mixing, connecting, but also juxtaposing personal experiences, public memory, political rhetoric, places, times, and artifacts. Collectively, these acts and arts of collective remembering tell about possible futures―and the past’s futures―what life during the Cold War might have been but also what it has become.\n\n\nAlone in the Dark: Cinephilia and the Heroic Imagination\n\nAuthor: Doug Dibbern\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0475.1.00\n\n\nA Grammar of the Jewish Arabic Dialect of Gabes\n\nAuthor: Wiktor Gębski\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0394\nThis volume undertakes a linguistic exploration of the endangered Arabic dialect spoken by the Jews of Gabes, a coastal city situated in Southern Tunisia. Belonging to the category of sedentary North African dialects, this variety is now spoken by a dwindling number of native speakers, primarily in Israel and France. Given the imminent extinction faced by many modern varieties of Judaeo-Arabic, including Jewish Gabes, the study’s primary goal is to document and describe its linguistic nuances while reliable speakers are still accessible. Data for this comprehensive study were collected during fieldwork in Israel and France between December 2018 and March 2022.\n\n\nTangible and Intangible Heritage in the Age of Globalisation\n\nEditor: Lilia Makhloufi\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0388\nTangible and Intangible Heritage in the Age of Globalisation offers a rich collection of perspectives on the complex interplay between tangible and intangible heritage. These essays illustrate the need to redefine heritage as an interdisciplinary and intercultural concept. They interrogate heritage paradigms while also providing concrete recommendations to promote the preservation of physical heritage spaces, and the cultural practices and social relationships that depend on them.\n\n\nNeural Networks\n\nAuthor: Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal\nAuthor: Théo Lepage-Richer\nAuthor: Lucy Suchman\nLüneburg: meson press, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/0832\nNeural Networks proposes to reconstruct situated practices, social histories, mediating techniques, and ontological assumptions that inform the computational project of the same name. If so-called machine learning comprises a statistical approach to pattern extraction, then neural networks can be defined as a biologically inspired model that relies on probabilistically weighted neuron-like units to identify such patterns. Far from signaling the ultimate convergence of human and machine intelligence, however, neural networks highlight the technologization of neurophysiology that characterizes virtually all strands of neuroscientific and AI research of the past century. Taking this traffic as its starting point, this volume explores how cognition came to be constructed as essentially computational in nature, to the point of underwriting a technologized view of human biology, psychology, and sociability, and how countermovements provide resources for thinking otherwise.\n\n\nHeavy Metal: Earth’s Minerals and the Future of Sustainable Societies\n\nEditor: Philippe D.

This volume aims to provoke new debate about the continued currency of Russian literature as symbolic capital for international readers, in particular for nations seeking to create or consolidate cultural and political leverage in the so-called ‘World Republic of Letters’. It also seeks to examine and contrast the mechanisms of the translation and uses of Russian literature across the globe."

While these two developments are well-known, they are usually studied in isolation. Tarasov’s study has the great merit of showing the connection between the art world in Russia and the West, and its impact in the cultural history of the continent in the pre-war period."

This has shifted government funding and support towards the urban areas leaving rural areas destitute.\nIn State Power in Land Reform, the author relies on a robust theoretical frame, extensive policy analysis and empirical data to advocate for a new engagement with local communities through rejuvenated municipalities, that is, through strong local institutions.\nState Power in Land Reform provides a valuable analytical account for both the historian and the archive.\n\n\nRevisiting Africa’s Flagship Universities: Local, National and International Dynamics\n\nAuthor: James Ransom\nCape Town: African Minds, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502951\nRevisiting Africa’s Flagship Universities: National, International, and Local Dynamics offers a compelling exploration of Africa’s large, public higher education institutions.

This collection proposes that it can be creative writing aimed at the heart, rather than information directed to the mind.\nFicSci playfully subverts the term ‘science fiction’ to offer an experimental process that explores the limits of imagination in relation to scientific possibility (and vice versa). FicSci is an experiment in hybridized creative practice that induces new forms of knowledge-making between the hard sciences and the social world. This collection offers writing that emerged from an encounter that brought twelve creative writers together with an astronomer.\nThe presented science invited contemplation of scientific aspects of the night sky, in specific X-ray binary stars, extra-galactic sources, and magellanic clouds. The creative writings that emerged are attendant to the wider potentialities of scientific thought, and reveal how methodologies for storying the scientific encounter are creatively multi-form.\n\n\nRocklands: On Becoming the First Generation of Black Psychologists in Post-Apartheid South Africa\n\nAuthor: Liezille Jean Jacobs\nCape Town: African Minds, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502890\nThis book makes a brave and erudite scholarly contribution to the field of psychology.

From a narrative of survival in 2020 to contain the spread of the virus with a central role of government leadership, evidence-informed decisions, solidarity and a scientific race to develop a vaccine taking the central stage; to a later narrative in 2021 focused on socio-economic recovery, building back better, managing vaccine inequalities and visions and proposals for post-COVID societies.\nIn 2022, we have seen a move to a narrative of post-pandemic (rather than post-COVID-19) and “learning to live with the virus” with societies in the global South learning to navigate the harsh economic realities by looking at opportunities emerging in the digital and regional spaces. The production of this book embeds some of these dominant narratives in different chapters, as they were developed over such unstable ground.\nThis experience has put a spotlight on the importance of innovative solutions, and the role of public sector, raising a new interest in governance systems and structures, and ways to strengthen governance overall. The pandemic has propelled countries across the world to innovate and develop more resilient systems and strategies that will enable us to gain the capacity to tackle complex challenges we face today and those that will come.\nWe hope this book helps us extract some valuable lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. After all, learning from a crisis may well be our best way to prepare for the future."

While Covid-19 demonstrated some of the benefits of online learning, the widespread, often uncritical adoption of online tools driven by necessity has left many with an experience of ‘emergency online learning’. This book aims to assist in the design of technology-enhanced capacity development by sharing evidence of practices that are principled rather than rushed; inclusive rather than creating new digital divides.\n\n\nWho Counts?: Ghanaian Academic Publishing and Global Science\n\nAuthor: David Mills\nAuthor: Patricia Kingori\nAuthor: Abigail Branford\nAuthor: Samuel T. Chatio\nAuthor: Natasha Robinson\nAuthor: Paulina Tindana\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502647\nSince the 1990s, global academic publishing has been transformed by digitisation, consolidation and the rise of the internet. The data produced by commercially owned citation indexes increasingly defines legitimate academic knowledge. Publication in prestigious ‘high impact’ journals can be traded for academic promotion, tenure and job-security. African researchers and publishers labour in the shadows of a global knowledge system dominated by ‘Northern’ journals and by global publishing conglomerates. This book goes beyond the numbers. It tells the story of how the Ghanaian academy is being transformed by this bibliometric economy. It offers a rich account of the voices and perspectives of Ghanaian academics and African journal publishers. How, where and when are Ghana’s researchers disseminating their work, and what do these experiences reveal about an unequal global science system? Is there pressure to publish in ‘reputable’ international journals, what role do supervisors, collaborators and mentors play, and how do academics manage in conditions of scarcity? Putting the insights of more than 40 Ghanaian academics into dialogue with journal editors and publishers from across the continent, the book highlights creative responses, along with the emergence of new regional research ecosystems. This is an important Africa-centred analysis of Anglophone academic publishing on the continent and its relationship to global science."

Ideas are presented from multiple historical and contemporary perspectives, while inviting new voices to participate in discussions about the future of the African moving image.\nReframing Africa?makes a plea for the recognition, preservation and repatriation of the African moving image archive, advancing ideas about how it speaks to contemporary Africans, possessed of the power to elucidate their lived experiences and to reorientate perceptions of the past, present and future. On the basis of this wide-ranging appreciation of the archive, the book charts a way forward for African-inflected film studies as well as other programmes in the humanities and social sciences.\nReframing Africa? will appeal to scholars, academics and practitioners across the continent and beyond."

It is intended to be a map, and like any map it does not contain all the contours and details of the landscape, but rather seeks to reveal the important pathways and milestones in the journey to becoming an established academic.\nDrawing on highly experienced academics and accomplished professors in their different fields, as well as promising younger academics already on their way, this book cover a concentrated resource of practical wisdom. The topics are broad and, cumulatively, they seek to answer the many questions that experienced mentors encounter every day in their work with new academics."

Yet, schools, as the main providers of formal education, have increasingly come into question concerning their role in manifesting and perpetuating social categorisations, inequalities and discrimination instead of decreasing existing fragmentations and challenging power relations and hierarchies.\nAs a diverse society, Kenya is faced with power struggles and rivalries between different groups – for instance, along ethnic lines, often constructed deep in colonial history. This affects teaching and learning in school and the result is that Kenya is faced with vast disparities in terms of educational access and success – rendering some social groups marginalised and others favoured.\nPositioning Diversity at Kenyan Schools explores the ways in which teachers in Kenyan primary and secondary schools experience and deal with social categorisations and diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, wealth, culture, religion, etc. in their professional practice and in the current education system. Using critical pedagogy and diversity theory as a lens for positioning diversity in Kenyan schools, the questions that this book sets out to answer are: In what ways do the teachers’ and schools’ practices lead to transformation in terms of more social equality and less discrimination? In what ways do the practices manifest existing group categorisations, hierarchies and discrimination? How can schools and teaching practices in postcolonial Kenya become more inclusive and foster social cohesion and equality?\n\n\nOut of Place: An Autoethnography of Postcolonial Citizenship\n\nAuthor: Nuraan Davids\nForeword by: Jonathan D Jansen\nCape Town: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502364\nOut of Place offers an in-depth exploration of Nuraan Davids’ experience as a Muslim ‘coloured’ woman, traversing a post-apartheid space. It centres on and explores a number of themes, which include her challenges not only as a South African citizen, and within her faith community, but as an academic citizen at a historically white university. The book is her story, an autoethnography, her reparation.\nBy embarking on an auto-ethnography, she not only tries to change the way her story has been told by others, transforms her ‘sense of what it means to live’ (Bhabha, 1994). She is driven by a postcolonial appeal, which insists that if she seeks to imprint her own way of life into the discourses which pervade the world around her, then she can no longer allow herself to be spoken on behalf of or to be subjugated into the hegemonies of others.\nThe main argument of Out of Place is that Muslim, ‘coloured’ women are subjected to layers of scrutiny and prejudices, which have yet to be confronted. What we know about Muslim ‘coloured’ women has been shaped by preconceived notions of ‘otherness’, and attached to a meta-narrative of ‘oppression and backwardness’. By centring and using her lived experiences, the author takes readers on a journey of what it is like to be seen in terms of race, gender and religion – not only within the public sphere of her professional identities, but within the private sphere of her faith community.\n\n\nLow-Income Students, Human Development and Higher Education in South Africa: Opportunities, Obstacles and Outcomes\n\nAuthor: Melanie Walker\nAuthor: Monica McLean\nAuthor: Mikateko Mathebula\nAuthor: Patience Mukwambo\nCape Town: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502395"

Comprised of 16 studies focused on activities at a range of colleges and universities across the country, these chapters aim to promote a better understanding of open learning practices across the Post-School Education and Training (PSET) sector, including issues such as: recognition of prior learning, access for students with disabilities, work integrated learning, professional development, novel student funding mechanisms, leadership for open educational practices, institutional culture, student support, blended and online learning, flexible learning, online assessment, open educational resource development models and funding, and micro-credentials.\nThis collection of peer-reviewed chapters contributes to understanding the ways in which South African PSET institutions and educators are interpreting ‘open learning’ as a means of advancing social justice. It includes a historical and contemporary understanding of the economic, cultural and political obstacles facing PSET, drawing on Nancy Fraser’s theory of social justice as ‘participatory parity’ to better understand the ways in which ‘open learning’ may address systemic social injustices in order to allow South African students and educators to thrive.\nThis volume emerges from research conducted by the Cases on Open Learning (COOL) project, an initiative by the Department of Higher Education and Training in partnership with the Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa."

It focuses on how neoliberalism has worked to transform the university sector and the academic profession. In particular, it examines how understandings of, and control over, what constitutes relevant knowledge have changed.\nTaken as a whole, these changes have sought to reorient universities and academics towards economic development in various ways. This includes the installation of strategies for how institutions and academics achieve recognition and status within the academy, the privatisation of educational services and the downgrading of the value of public higher education, as well as a steady shift away from the public funding for universities. Research universities are increasingly adopting a user- and market-oriented model, with an emphasis on meeting corporate demands, the privileging of short-term research, and a strong tendency to view utility, and the potential to sell intellectual property for profit, as primary criteria for determining the relevance of academic knowledge."

It includes not only images of the monument and the frieze but also many related documents and artworks. The corpus aims to promote studies of controversial monuments, with a focus on visual interpretation.\nFor the first time the 92-metre frieze of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, one of the largest historical narratives in marble, has been made the subject of a book.\nThe pictorial narrative of the Boer pioneers who conquered South Africa’s interior during the ‘Great Trek’ (1835-52) represents a crucial period of South Africa’s past. Forming the concept of the frieze both reflected on and contributed to the country’s socio-political debates in the 1930s and 1940s when it was made. The frieze is unique in that it provides rare evidence of the complex processes followed in creating a major monument.\nBased on unpublished documents, drawings and models, these processes are unfolded step by step, from the earliest discussions of the purpose and content of the frieze through all the stages of its design to its shipping to post-war Italy to be copied into marble and final installation in the Monument. The book examines how visual representation transforms historical memory in what it chooses to recount, and the forms in which it depicts this. It also investigates the active role the Monument played in the development of apartheid, and its place in post-apartheid heritage.\nThis second volume expands on the first, considering each of the 27 scenes in depth, providing new insights into not only the frieze, but also South Africa’s history."

His individualistic and eclectic sound draws on American, classical and township influences. He had no apparent formal music training and grew up in a poor village on the outskirts of Durban where, at the fairly late age of seventeen, he discovered that he had an innate ability to play. He has become a key inspiration for aspiring young South African jazz musicians and has left an infinite source of knowledge to draw on.\nThe Artistry of Bheki Mseleku is an in-depth study of the Mseleku’s compositional works and improvisational style. The annotated transcriptions and analysis bring into focus the exquisite skill and artistry that ultimately caught the eye of some of the most celebrated international jazz musicians in the world.\n“Despite being entirely self-taught, Mseleku was the most technically sophisticated of jazz musicians, though the abiding experience of hearing him play was one of an unjazzlike simplicity.” – John Fordham, The Guardian"

An investigation of Afrocentric business ethics is long overdue. Attempting to understand the actions and efforts of informal traders and artisans from their own points of view, and analysing how they organise and get by, allows for viable approaches to be identified to integrate them into global urban models and cultures."

What has not received sufficient attention, is the contribution of the university to place-based development.\nThis volume is the first in South Africa to engage seriously with the place-based developmental role of universities. In the international literature and policy there has been an increasing integration of the university with place-based development, especially in cities. This volume weighs in on the debate by drawing attention to the place-based roles and agency of South African universities in their local towns and cities. It acknowledges that universities were given specific development roles in regions, homelands and towns under apartheid, and comments on why sub-national, place-based development has not been a key theme in post-apartheid, higher education planning."

These challenges include: unequal access to education; variable quality of educational resources, teaching, and student performance; and increasing cost and concern about the sustainability of education. The Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project seeks to build on and contribute to the body of research on how OER can help to improve access, enhance quality and reduce the cost of education in the Global South. This volume examines aspects of educator and student adoption of OER and engagement in Open Educational Practices (OEP) in secondary and tertiary education as well as teacher professional development in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia. The ROER4D studies and syntheses presented here aim to help inform Open Education advocacy, policy, practice and research in developing countries.\n\n\nNorth-South Knowledge Networks: Towards Equitable Collaboration Between Academics, Donors and Universities\n\nEditor: Tor Halvorsen\nEditor: Jorun Nossum\nCape Town: African Minds, 2017\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928331308\nSince the 1990s, internationalisation has become key for institutions wishing to secure funding for higher education and research. For the academic community, this strategic shift has had many consequences. Priorities have changed and been influenced by new ways of thinking about universities, and of measuring their impact in relation to each other and to their social goals. Debates are ongoing and hotly contested."

The bulk of existing evidence about the impact of open data, however, focuses on high-income countries. Much less is known about open data’s role and value in low- and middle-income countries, and more generally about its possible contributions to economic and social development.\nOpen Data for Developing Economies features in-depth case studies on how open data is having an impact across the developing world-from an agriculture initiative in Colombia to data-driven healthcare projects in Uganda and South Africa to crisis response in Nepal. The analysis built on these case studies aims to create actionable intelligence regarding: (a) the conditions under which open data is most (and least) effective in development, presented in the form of a Periodic Table of Open Data; (b) strategies to maximize the positive contributions of open data to development; and (c) the means for limiting open data’s harms on developing countries."

To drive this transformation in ways that bring about social, environmental and economic justice at a local, national, regional and global levels, new knowledge and strong cross-regional networks capable of foregrounding different realities, needs and agendas will be essential. In fact, the power of knowledge matters today in ways that humanity has probably never experienced before, placing an emphasis on the roles of research, academics and universities."

Most authors are early career academics who teach and conduct research in universities across the continent and came together for a research project, and related workshops and a symposium on student representation in African higher education governance.\nThe book includes theoretical chapters on student organising, student activism and representation; chapters on historical and current developments in student politics in Anglophone and Francophone Africa, and in-depth case studies on student representation and activism in a cross-section of universities and countries.\nThe book provides a unique resource for academics, university leaders and student affairs professionals as well as student leaders and policy-makers in Africa and elsewhere.\n\n\nReflections of South African University Leaders: 1981 to 2014\n\nEditor: Council on Higher Education\nCape Town: African Minds, 2016\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928331094\nThe inspiration for this collection arose in late 2013 in the Council on Higher Education’s (CHE) Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate, the directorate responsible for conducting research on the higher education landscape and monitoring the state of the sector over time. They noted that conditions besetting universities had grown increasingly complex, both globally but more especially locally, and the question arose – how had this altered the challenges to university leadership over the period, say, between the new political dispensation ushered in in 1994 and the second decade of the new millennium? More particularly, how had leaders with a proven track record of visionary and strong leadership during this period faced these challenges? How did they see the main changes that needed dealing with? What challenges did these changes pose and how were they successfully overcome? What did they think, looking back, were the main constituents of successful leadership and management? What wisdom could be distilled for posterity? The Directorate decided to invite a range of vice-chancellors and senior academic leaders who had completed their terms of office to contribute to a project that set out to gather such reflections and compile them into a publication."

Laws and practices governing citizenship effectively leave hundreds of thousands of people in Africa without a country. These stateless Africans can neither vote nor stand for office; they cannot enrol their children in school, travel freely, or own property; they cannot work for the government; they are exposed to human rights abuses. Statelessness exacerbates and underlies tensions in many regions of the continent. Citizenship Law in Africa, a comparative study by two programs of the Open Society Foundations, describes the often arbitrary, discriminatory, and contradictory citizenship laws that exist from state to state and recommends ways that African countries can bring their citizenship laws in line with international rights norms. The report covers topics such as citizenship by descent, citizenship by naturalisation, gender discrimination in citizenship law, dual citizenship, and the right to identity documents and passports. It is essential reading for policymakers, attorneys, and activists.\n\n\nDoctoral Education in South Africa: Policy, Discourse and Data\n\nAuthor: Nico Cloete\nAuthor: Johann Mouton\nAuthor: Charles Sheppard\nCape Town: African Minds, 2016\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928331001\nWorldwide, in Africa and in South Africa, the importance of the doctorate has increased disproportionately in relation to its share of the overall graduate output over the last decade. This heightened attention has not only been concerned with the traditional role of the PhD, namely the provision of a future supply of academics. Rather, it has focused on the increasingly important role that higher education – particularly high-level skills – is perceived to play in national development and the knowledge economy."

It breaks away from the immediacy of personal understanding by placing education within wider, deeper and longer contexts. Boundaries of the Educational Imagination develops the educational imagination by answering six questions:\n\nWhat happens when we expand continuously outwards from one school to all the schools of the world?\nWhat happens if we go inside a school and explore how its material equipment has changed over the past 300 years?\nWhat is the smallest educational unit in our brain and how does it allow an almost infinite expansion of knowledge?\nWhat is the highest level of individual development we can teach students to aspire towards?\nWhat role does education play in a world that is producing more and more complex knowledge increasingly quickly?\nHow do small knowledge elements combine to produce increasingly complex knowledge forms?"

These essays talk to what a provincial education department does and how and why it does these things – whether it be about policy, resourcing or implementing projects. Each essay is written by one or more specialist in the relevant focus area.\nThe book is written to be accessible to the general reader as well as being informative and an essential resource for the specialist reader. It sheds light on aspects of how a provincial department operates and why and with what consequences certain decisions have been made in education over the last 20 turbulent years, both nationally and provincially.\nThere has been no attempt to fit the book’s chapters into a particular ideological or educational paradigm, and as a result the reader will find differing views on various aspects of the Gauteng Department of Education’s present and past. We leave the reader to decide to what extent the GDE has fulfilled its educational mandate over the last 20 years.\n\n\nLeadeship and Management: Case Studies in Training in Higher Education in Africa\n\nEditor: Johann Mouton\nEditor: Lauren Wildschut\nCape Town: African Minds, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920677893"

Several techniques such as genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, simulated annealing, tabu search and others have been used. This book is devoted to compiling all the techniques that have been used to solve the channel allocation problem. Each of the methods is described fully in a manner that explains the essential parts of how the techniques are formulated and applied in solving the problem. This textbook will be helpful to students studying communications or researchers as it compiles all the techniques used since this problem was first solved."

It has created a framework of democratic legislative, executive and judicial institutions that mark a clear break from the apartheid past. In theory, they are inclusive and offer every citizen equal access to constitutionally protected rights. Their capacity to deliver, however, is coming under increasing pressure and, as this happens, citizen confidence in their efficacy is waning.\nMuch of the pressure, which ultimately may affect their legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary citizens, stems from the desperation and sense of economic exclusion experienced by those who find themselves at the wrong end of South Africa’s grossly unequal society. If this decline in trust persists, the cohesive effects of the country’s democratic institutions will diminish, and instability will become an increasingly common feature of political contestation.\n\n\nSystemic School Improvement Interventions in South Africa: Some Practical Lessons from Development Practioners\n\nEditor: Godwin Khosa\nCape Town, South Africa: African Minds, 2014\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920677374\n\n\nPerspectives on Students Affairs\n\nEditor: McGlory Speckman\nEditor: Martin Mandew\nForeword by: Ahmed Bawa\nCape Town: African Minds, 2014\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920677442\nThe goal of Perspectives on Student Affairs in South Africa is to generate interest in student affairs in South Africa. The papers contained herein are based on best practice, local experience and well-researched international and local theories.\nThe papers in this book deal with matters pertaining to international and national trends in student affairs: academic development, access and retention, counselling, and material support for students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are linked to national and international developments, as described in the first two papers.\nThis publication will assist both young and experienced practitioners as they grow into their task of developing the students entrusted to them.\nAll contributors are South Africans with a great deal of experience in student affairs, and all are committed to the advancement of student affairs in South Africa. The editors are former heads of student affairs portfolios at two leading South African universities."

Yet the risk that future generations of South Africans will not know their musical roots is very real. Of all the recordings made here since the 1930s, thousands have been lost for ever, for the powers-that-be never deemed them worthy of preservation. And if one peruses the books that exist on South African popular music, one still finds that their authors have on occasion jumped to conclusions that were not as foregone as they had assumed. Yet the fault lies not with them, rather in the fact that there has been precious little documentation in South Africa of who played what, or who recorded what, with whom, and when. This is true of all music-making in this country, though it is most striking in the musics of the black communities.\n\n\nThe University in Africa and Democratic Citizenship: Hothouse or Training Ground?\n\nAuthor: Thierry Luescher-Mamashela\nCape Town, South Africa: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920355678\n\n\nReflections on Identity in Four African Cities\n\nEditor: Simon Bekker\nEditor: Anne Leilde\nCape Town, South Africa: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920051402\n\n\nLinking Higher Education & Economic Development: Implications For Africa From Three Successful Systems\n\nAuthor: Pundy Pillay\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920355449\nFinland, South Korea and the state of North Carolina in the United States are three systems that successfully have harnessed higher education in their economic development initiatives. Common to the success of the all these systems is, amongst others, the link between economic and education planning, quality public schooling, high tertiary participation rates with institutional differentiation, labour market demand, cooperation and networks, and consensus about the importance of higher education for development.\n\n\nHigher Education Financing in East and Southern Africa\n\nEditor: Pundy Pillay\nCape Town, South Africa: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920355333\n\n\nWildland Fire Management Handbook for Sub-Sahara Africa\n\nEditor: Johann G. Goldammer\nEditor: Cornelis de Ronde\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928331629\nFire has been used as a land-use tool for controlling the environment since the early evolution of humanity. Fire continues to be used as such by people living in different ecosystems across sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the rich biodiversity of tropical and subtropical savannas, grasslands and fire ecosystems is attributed to the regular occurrence and influence of fire. However, wildfires have been harmful to ecosystems, economies and human security. This is due to increasing population pressure as well as increased vulnerability of agricultural and residential lands.\nThe Wildland Fire Management Handbook provides scientific guidelines for maintaining and stabilising ecosystems and for state-of-the art fire prevention and control. The handbook features contributors from diverse backgrounds in wildland fire science and fire management. It deals with topics ranging from fire behaviour and controlled burning to fire ecology and the effects of burning on Cape fynbos. In addition the Wildland Fire Management Handbook includes fire regimes and fire history in West Africa. Thus, the handbook is groundbreaking in its furthering of sub-Saharan Africa’s capacity for fire management and consequent preservation of the environment. The Wildland Fire Management Handbook is an important resource for strategic sustainable land-use planning, disaster management and land security. The handbook is well suited to the needs of wildland fire management practitioners, scientists, academics, and students of universities and technical schools. Thus, environmental consultants, conservationists, ecologists and those dealing with wildland fire disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation will be interested in the book.\n\n\nSome Developments in Research in Science and Mathematics in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nEditor: Lorna Holtman\nEditor: Cyril Julie\nEditor: Øyvind Mikalsen\nEditor: David Mtetwa\nEditor: Meshach Ogunniyi\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920299293\nMuch attention in late-developing countries is given to providing access to studies which allow school leavers to enter science and technology-related careers. These programmes are driven by the belief that graduates will then substantially contribute to the developmental needs of their countries.\nBut is providing access to institutions enough? Students in developing countries often come from school environments lacking in resources – human, physical and financial. This book, in a number of chapters, reviews research related to the crucial dimension of epistemological access to the disciplines of import, which students need as much as institutional access in order to improve their chances of success.\nA significant feature of this collection’s research studies is that their empirical bases are highly localised, covering areas such as: research methods; access; curriculum, instruction and assessment; and the relevance of science and mathematics education in Zimbabwe, Uganda, Swaziland, South Africa, Namibia, Malawi, Ghana and Lesotho.\nThis volume provides invaluable insights and will be of relevance to researchers, policy makers and lecturers interested in these research outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is the outcome of a doctoral research capacity development project, the Graduate Studies in Science, Mathematics and Technology Education (GRASSMATE).\n\n\nCareer Choice: The Voices of Music Students\n\nEditor: Taryn Arnott\nEditor: Louise Saunders\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920299309\nIt is most times not easy for school leavers to make the right choices about the field of academic study that would help them attain their career visions. Factors including family upbringing, social-cultural experiences, early education, peer associations and perception of self all impact on the career choices of young persons.\nThis book researches and presents a sampling of first-hand accounts of the personal journeys towards the choice of music as a field of specialisation written by students at the Department of Music, University of Pretoria, South Africa. The self-explorations included in the book are insightful glimpses into the individual histories of the students that are worth telling.

The African Classical Ensemble Music: Theory and Drum-based Concert Series is intended to empower literacy-driven ensemble creativity which, in turn, advances the philosophical, theoretical, medical and humanizing imperatives of African indigenous musical arts lore.\n\n\nFocus on Fresh Data on the Language of Instruction in Tanzania and South Africa\n\nAuthor: Birgit Brock-Utne\nAuthor: Zubeida Desai\nAuthor: Martha Qorro\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920051464\nThis is a series of books from the LOITASA (Language of Instruction in Tanzania and South Africa) project. LOITASA is a NUFU-funded (Norwegian University Fund) project which began in January 2002 and continued till the end of 2006. It is, what in donor circles is known as a ‘South-South-North’ cooperation project which, in this case, involves research cooperation between South Africa, Tanzania and Norway. The first book, entitled Language of instruction in Tanzania and South Africa (LOITASA), focused on the current language in education situation in the two countries by providing a description and analysis of existing language policies and practices.\n\n\nEducational Challenges in Multilingual Societies: LOITASA Phase Two Research\n\nEditor: Martha Qorro\nEditor: Birgit Brock-Utne\nEditor: Zubeida Desai\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920489069\nThis book is the sixth in a series of books from the LOITASA (Language of Instruction in Tanzania and South Africa) project and reflects the work done in the sixth year of the project. This book has its main focus research carried out in South Africa and Tanzania on the language of instruction issue.\n\n\nUniversities in Africa and Democratic Citizenship\n\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nThe University in Africa and Democratic Citizenship By Thierry M Luescher-Mamashela with Sam Kiiru, Robert Mattes, Angolwisye Mwollo-ntallima, Njuguna Ng’ethe and Michelle Romo\nWhether and how higher education in Africa contributes to democratisation beyond producing the professionals that are necessary for developing and sustaining a modern political system, remains an unresolved question. This report, then, represents an attempt to address the question of whether there are university-specific mechanisms or pathways by which higher education contributes to the development of democratic attitudes and behaviours among students, and how these mechanisms operate and relate to politics both on and off campus.\nThe research shows that the potential of a university to act as training ground for democratic citizenship is best realised by supporting students’ exercise of democratic leadership on campus. This, in turn, develops and fosters democratic leadership in civil society. Thus, the university’s response to student political activity, student representation in university governance and other aspects of extra-curricular student life needs to be examined for ways in which African universities can instil and support democratic values and practices. Encouraging and facilitating student leadership in various forms of on-campus political activity and in a range of student organisations emerges as one of the most promising ways in which African universities can act as training grounds for democratic citizenship.\nThe following implications for African universities can be derived from the research findings and conclusions:\nIt is necessary to stimulate a series of dialogues between key stakeholders on student development as a pathway to democratic citizenship development in Africa. In-depth investigations into democratic best practice of student development and student leadership development should be conducted and the findings published in a series of handbooks for use by student development professionals in African universities. Further surveys should be conducted at other African universities to corroborate the findings and conclusions of this study. A study of the role of students and faculty in the current political transitions in West and North Africa (e.g. Egypt, Ivory Coast, South Sudan, Tunisia) should be conducted.\n\n\nShaping the Future of South Africa’s Youth: Rethinking Post-School Education and Skills Training\n\nEditor: Helene Perold\nEditor: Nico Cloete\nEditor: Joy Papier\nCape Town: African Minds, 2012\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781920489465\nSouth Africa has made huge gains in ensuring universal enrolment for children at school, and in restructuring and recapitalising the FET college sector. However, some three million young people are not in education, employment or training and the country faces serious challenges in providing its youth with the pathways and support they need to transition successfully into a differentiated system of post-school education and training."

The book turns the well-known sites of contemporary Euro-American democracy – elections, bureaucracies, public debates and citizen participation – into fluctuating democratic situations where supposedly untouchable democratic ideals are contested and warped in practice. The empirical cases demonstrate that democracy cannot be reduced to theoretical schemes of conflict, institutions or deliberation. Instead, they offer an urgently needed renewal of our understanding of democratic politics at a time when conventional ideas increasingly fail to capture current events such as Brexit, Trump and Covid19."

Current debates around encryption have fundamental implications for our individual liberties and collective presence on the Internet. Encryption of communications at scale and in increasingly usable ways has become a matter of public concern, especially since Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations. A new cryptographic imaginary is taking hold, which sees encryption as a necessary precondition for the formation of networked publics. At the same time, there have been major evolutions and accelerations in the field of secure communications, prompted in part by the cryptography community’s renewed efforts to create next-generation secure messaging protocols and applications. The book explores developers’ actions and their interactions with other stakeholders, for instance users, security trainers, standardising bodies, and funding organizations. It also examines their interactions with the technical artifacts they develop, in which a core common objective is to create tools that “conceal for freedom” even as how this objective is met differs according to technical architectures, the user publics being targeted and the tools’ underlying values and business models."

Suggestions to deliberately alter, to engineer, the Earth’s climate have gained political currency in recent years not as a positive vision of techno-scientific innovation, but as a daunting measure of last resort. The controversial status of various so-called climate engineering proposals raises a simple, yet pressing question: How has it has come to this? And, more specifically, how did such contested measures earn their place on policy agendas, despite enormous scientific complexities and fierce political contestation?"

But what does it mean to be with microbes? With Microbes sets microbes and the multiple ways they exist around, in and on humans at center stage. In this book, 24 social scientists and artists attune to microbes and describe their complicated relationships with humans and other beings. The book shows the multiplicity of these relationships and their dynamism, through detailed ethnographies of the relationships between humans, animals, plants, and microbes. Ethnographic explorations with fermented foods, waste, faecal matter, immunity, antimicrobial resistance, phages, as well as indigenous and scientific understandings of microbes challenge ideas of them being simple entities: not just pathogenic foes, old friends or good fermentation minions, but so much more. By describing these complex, dynamic, and ever-changing entanglements between humans and microbes, the chapters raise crucial points about how microbes are ‘known’ and how social scientists can study microbes with ethnographic methods, more often than not in the absence of microscopes, models, and computations. Following these various entanglements, the book tells how these relations transform both humans and microbes in the process.\n\n\nEnvironmental Alterities\n\nEditor: Antonia Walford\nEditor: Cristóbal Bonelli\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9781912729142\nIn the context of accelerating environmental crises and exhausted intellectual paradigms, this book asks what comes after ‘after nature’. Instead of demanding new models and approaches, it invites its readers to look to the endpoints and failures of what is already known, in order to generate alternative forms of ethical engagement with worlds both on this planet, and beyond it. Drawing together scholarship from across science and technology studies, philosophy, and anthropology and bringing it into conversation with rich ethnographic and empirical material, the book asks how we might potentialise the contradictions and oppositions of critical social scientific thinking in order to develop a mode of paradoxical engagement that is in constant movement between knowledge and its edges, practices and their limits, and which allows us to relate to that which is excessive to relations and relationality."

Contributions in this volume examine how sensing devices gain political and epistemic relevance in various forms of in/security, from border control, regulation, and epidemiological tracking, to aerial surveillance and hacking.

Synthesised voices, punctuated by occasional jingles, recount energy policy announcements, remarks about energy conservation made on social media, information about current energy demand and production, and comments entered by other Babble users.\nDeveloped for members of UK community groups working to promote sustainable energy practices, the Energy Babbles were designed to reflect the complex situations they navigate, to provide information and encourage communication, and to help shed light on their engagements with energy policy and practice. This book tells the story of the Babbles from a mix of design and STS perspectives, suggesting how design may benefit from the perspectives of STS, and how STS may take an interventionist, design-led approach to the study of emerging technological issues."

Rather than uncovering or building up one story about the Danish-Ghanaian past, the work insists on providing ‘inconclusive’ analyses, collaboratively generated in the course of the project work and in the process of writing ethnographically about it. The ambition is to nurture fieldwork as an opportunity for creating a common ground, on which to think about what heritage and ethnography could be. Common ground, then, is not only an ideal of the joint heritage project, but an expression of an anthropological ambition. In consequence, the book is an account of a particular ethnographic research project – the ‘methods story’ being about how post-colonial relations might be noticed and supported and about how empirical research is done as relations between what is going on in the field and the way that the ethnographer chooses to tell the story of the field in the text.\n\n\nInventing the Social\n\nEditor: Noortje Marres\nEditor: Michael Guggenheim\nEditor: Alex Wilkie\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9780995527768\nInventing the Social, edited by Noortje Marres, Michael Guggenheim and Alex Wilkie, showcases recent efforts to develop new ways of knowing society that combine social research with creative practice. With contributions from leading figures in sociology, architecture, geography, design, anthropology, and digital media, the book provides practical and conceptual pointers on how to move beyond the customary distinctions between knowledge and art, and on how to connect the doing, researching and making of social life in potentially new ways.\nPresenting concrete projects with a creative approach to researching social life as well as reflections on the wider contexts from which these projects emerge, this collection shows how collaboration across social science, digital media and the arts opens up timely alternatives to narrow, instrumentalist proposals that seek to engineer behaviour and to design community from scratch. To invent the social is to recognise that social life is always already creative in itself and to take this as a starting point for developing different ways of combining representation and intervention in social life."

What drives us to grab a special offer, to enter the privileged circle of premium newspaper subscribers, to peruse the pages of an enticing magazine? Without doubt, it is curiosity — that essential force of everyday action which invites us to break from our habits and to become transported beyond our very selves.\nCuriosity (whether healthy or unhealthy) is one of the favourite tricks of market seduction. Capturing a public — attracting the attention of a reader, seducing a customer, meeting the expectations of a user, persuading a voter … — often requires the construction of a set of technical devices that can play upon people’s inner motivations.\n\n\nImagining Classrooms: Stories of children, teaching, and ethnography\n\nAuthor: Vicki Macknight\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2016\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9780993144967\n\n\nModes of Knowing: Resources from the Baroque\n\nEditor: John Law\nEditor: Evelyn Ruppert\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2016\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9780993144981\nHow might we think differently? This book is an attempt to respond to this question. Its contributors are all interested in non-standard modes of knowing. They are all more or less uneasy with the restrictions or the agendas implied by academic modes of knowing, and they have chosen to do this by working with, through, or against one important Western alternative — that of the baroque.\n\n\nPractising Comparison: Logics, Relations, Collaborations\n\nEditor: Michael Guggenheim\nEditor: Joe Deville\nEditor: Zuzana Hrdličková\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2016\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9780993144943\nThis book compares things, objects, concepts, and ideas. It is also about the practical acts of doing comparison. Comparison is not something that exists in the world, but a particular kind of activity.\nAgents of various kinds compare by placing things next to one another, by using software programs and other tools, and by simply looking in certain ways. Comparing like this is an everyday practice. But in the social sciences, comparing often becomes more burdensome, more complex, and more questions are asked of it.\nHow, then, do social scientists compare? What role do funders, their tools, and databases play in social scientific comparisons? Which sorts of objects do they choose to compare and how do they decide which comparisons are meaningful? Doing comparison in the social sciences, it emerges, is a practice weighed down by a history in which comparison was seen as problematic. As it plays out in the present, this history encounters a range of other agents also involved in doing comparison who may challenge the comparisons of social scientists themselves."

From handbags to houses, barrels to databases, captivating gameworlds to the “bag of stars” that Ursula Le Guin calls the universe, containers furnish infrastructures for living and action while extending our capacities for managing things across space and time. They not only give shape to our lifeworlds: they form and transform our bodies and being.\nThe chapters in Containment: Technologies of Holding, Filtering, Leaking traverse technologies, bodies, ontologies and imaginaries, reflecting on what different container technologies, containment strategies, and container metaphors tell us about ourselves and how we relate to our worlds. With common reference to Zoë Sofia’s (2000) foundational essay on container technologies, contributors draw on media and cultural studies, social history, architecture, and postdualistic approaches in philosophy and social science to explore liminalities of containment both as and beyond holding."

Als Neuverortung im Spannungsfeld medienökologischer, neomaterialistischer und technikfeministischer Theoriebildung werden hier all jene Widerständigkeiten und Un/Verfügbarkeiten sondiert, die von techno-kapitalistisch protegierten Operationen nicht zu tilgen sind. Was hieße es, die planetarische Implikation der Technosphäre aus Mikroperspektiven zu denken, mit ihren Überlappungen, Leerstellen, Fragmentierungen, Akkumulationen des Technischen zu schreiben? Entlang ihrer materiellen Prozessualität werden elementare Medien wie Regen, Minerale, Staub und Schaum zur Gegenwartsdiagnose. Angesichts der umfassenden Ökologisierungstendenzen und ihrer experimentellen Verarbeitung in Medienkunst und Interfacedesign verdichtet sich ein kritisches Begriffsinventar, das die makrologische Karriere des Technischen anders denkt.\n\n\nDemocratic Algorithms: Ethnography of a Public Recommender System\n\nAuthor: Nikolaus Poechhacker\nLüneburg: meson press, 2024\nCan an algorithm be democratic? And how can we understand algorithms not only as technical, but also as social and political phenomena? Democratic Algorithms offers theoretically and empirically informed perspectives on how we can imagine and design algorithms for a democratic society, and what we even mean by that. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, the book illustrates how a recommender system was built in a public broadcaster, raising questions not only about organizational and technical implementation, but also about the possible compatibility of such an algorithmic system with democratic constitutions.\n\n\nTacit Cinematic Knowledge: Approaches and Practices\n\nAuthor: Haritha R.\nAuthor: Claire Salles\nAuthor: Felix M.

In these places and institutions film and moving image technologies serve to advance knowledge, to show how things are done, to train, teach, educate, mobilize people, as well as to imagine complex social facts and visualize dynamic models and schemes through data visualizations, pattern recognition software, and in social graphs. But what these moving images do goes beyond instruction, illustration and visual education. This publication introduces the concept of tacit cinematic knowledge to designate a broad variety of epistemic environments in which knowledge is configured in and through cinematic practices, and in the interaction with moving images. The concept thus describes a challenge not only for film and media scholars, but also for social scientists, economists, data analysts and artists.\nCovering areas of study beyond the cinema and non-theatrical films which have recently become a focus of inquiry, the contributions analyze the operations of tacit cinematic knowledge in objects ranging from political campaigns, medical and scientific devices, corporate communications, devices for the study of animal behavior and more."

If so-called machine learning comprises a statistical approach to pattern extraction, then neural networks can be defined as a biologically inspired model that relies on probabilistically weighted neuron-like units to identify such patterns. Far from signaling the ultimate convergence of human and machine intelligence, however, neural networks highlight the technologization of neurophysiology that characterizes virtually all strands of neuroscientific and AI research of the past century. Taking this traffic as its starting point, this volume explores how cognition came to be constructed as essentially computational in nature, to the point of underwriting a technologized view of human biology, psychology, and sociability, and how countermovements provide resources for thinking otherwise."

To change this, we should not turn away from it, but look carefully into its transformative power and make operable alternatives such as counter-algorhythms and solidarity-oriented commoning.

By turning to infrastructures, their logic and functioning, collapse and malfunction, the volume reveals their potential as fragile material witnesses to and of disasters. As climate change is unequally distributed across continuous dynamics and events, time scales and spatial registers, infrastructures can be understood as proxies or seismographs mediating different spatio-temporal layers that make these dynamics tangible. Disaster is made operational by negotiating what is defined as such, and under which geopolitical conditions. What connects melting glaciers and the knowledge from ice cores to the mapping of the ocean floor and the extraction of resources in the deep-sea? How can infrastructures be thought in time and “critical proximity”, and how do they bear witness to colonial pasts and presents? The volume proposes an analytical perspective on infrastructures as multi-layered witnesses to climate change, bringing together scientific and artistic approaches, students and scholars from different disciplines."

Films, photographs, and documents have continued to emerge from the camp and become the focus of fierce legal and political battles, as well as intense moral anguish. This book looks at how the US Department of Defense has struggled, and often failed, to control the public perception of these media objects through complex, layered framing devices. It traces how small ruptures in the Department’s framings have provided openings for critical interventions from various fields – ranging from journalism and human rights law to the arts. Guantánamo Frames thus lays the groundwork for a critical reappraisal of the entanglement of media, violence, and the security state in a broader sense.\n\n\nNonconscious: On the Affective Synching of Mind and Machine\n\nAuthor: Marie-Luise Angerer\nLüneburg: meson press, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/2041\nGrowing numbers of nonhuman companions are creating affective synching between human and nonhuman agency.

Das Fahrrad ist nicht nur Medium des sozialen und ökologischen Wandels: Radfahren eröffnet Perspektiven, verändert Räume, lässt neue Relationen entstehen und teilt Handlungsmacht neu auf.\nFahrradutopien denkt vom Fahrrad aus und ergänzt dabei bestehende Ansätze zur Mobilitätsforschung um medienkulturwissenschaftliche Perspektiven. Die Beiträge verbinden Medienwissenschaften und Forschungen zu Fahrradaktivismus mit der Liebe zum Radfahren. Fokussiert werden Fahrradfilme und -vlogs, Verkehr und Infrastrukturen, Virtuelle Realität und Fahrrad, Fahrradkollektive und Fahrradfeminismus."

Dotzler\nLüneburg: meson press, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1983\nMitte der 1960er Jahre hat Michel Foucault die Methode der „Diskursanalyse“ in die Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften eingeführt. Besonders in der Archäologie des Wissens hat er dafür plädiert, die Geschichte des Wissens und der Wissenschaften zum Gegenstand diskursanalytischer Untersuchungen zu machen. Über ein halbes Jahrhundert später ist im Bereich der Informatik ein zunehmendes Interesse an der Diskursanalyse zu verzeichnen. In der Regel spielt Foucault dabei aber keine Rolle. Fern von jeder Archäologie setzen auch die Digital Humanities vermehrt auf die Analyse von historischen und gegenwärtigen Diskursen. Angesichts dieser Konjunkturen ist es an der Zeit, die Archäologie des Wissens neu zu lesen. Denn schon 1968 behauptete der französische Historiker Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie „Der zukünftige Historiker wird Programmierer sein, oder er wird nicht sein.“ Ein Jahr später gibt Foucault mit seinem Buch auf eben diese Herausforderung eine ebenso informierte wie nuancierte Antwort. Diese Antwort ist in ihrer Aktualität und Relevanz erst noch zu entdecken."

But what is generally ignored is its structural conservatism, its identitarian logic in which everything should remain in its place and nothing should mix, and its proximity to Nazi ideology and politics. By turning the spotlight on these neglected aspects, Uexküll’s Surroundings opens up a new perspective on Uexküll’s Umwelt theory."

First, technological innovations such as affective computing, mood tracking, sentiment analysis, and social robotics all share a focus on the recognition and modulation of human affectivity. Affect gets measured, calculated, controlled. Secondly, recent developments in politics, social media usage, and right-wing journalism have contributed to a conspicuous rise of hate speech, cybermobbing, public shaming, “felt truths,” and resentful populisms. In a very specific way, politics as well as power have become affective.\nAffect gets mobilized, fomented, unleashed.

For them, perhaps for us, it is a 39-minute and 13-second farewell. A long goodbye. My angle is different. By situating the Bowie/Renck collaboration on “Lazarus” in the context of a meditation on the question once posed by Georg Stanitzek, “Was ist Kommunikation?” I consider the CD and the video as experiments in re-configuration. More specifically, by thinking about the distinctly cinematic iteration of the question of communication (citing here Captain’s “what we have here is … failure to communicate” from Cool Hand Luke) I propose that mediated communication embodies the Ich/Es modality of dialogue disparaged by Martin Buber. What this invites us to consider is whether “Lazarus” in particular isn’t the generation of an audiovisual tombeau from which or out of which communication strains are to be heard. Is it “saying” farewell? Is it “saying” anything? By drawing on Jacques Derrida’s appropriation of the crypt in the work of Abraham and Torok, I propose that “Lazarus” manages (and the feat is neither small nor insignificant) to communicate nothing. In effect, “Lazarus” is the very sound, not of a failure to communicate, but of a “speaking” emptied of what protects it from mediation. Here, Bowie’s gnomic persona assumes a political valence not typically ascribed to it.\n\n\nBeyond the Flow: Scholarly Publications During and After the Digital\n\nAuthor: Niels-Oliver Walkowski\nLüneburg: meson press, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1600\nIn the wake of the so-called digital revolution numerous attempts have been made to rethink and redesign what scholarly publications can or should be.

Anthropology offers media archaeologies of markets, and the sociology of markets and finance unravels how contemporary financial markets have witnessed a media technological arms race. Building on such work, this volume brings together key thinkers of economic studies with German media theory, describes the central role of the media specificity of markets in new detail and inflects them in three distinct ways. Nik-Khah and Mirowski show how the denigration of human cognition and the concomitant faith in computation prevalent in contemporary market-design practices rely on neoliberal conceptions of information in markets. Schröter confronts the asymmetries and abstractions that characterize money as a medium and explores the absence of money in media. Beverungen situates these inflections and gathers further elements for a politically and historically attuned media theory of markets concerned with contemporary phenomena such as high-frequency trading and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nCommunication\n\nAuthor: Paula Bialski\nAuthor: Finn Brunton\nAuthor: Mercedes Bunz\nLüneburg: meson press, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1464\nContemporary communication puts us not only in conversation with one another but also with our machinery. Machine communication—to communicate not just via but also with machines—is therefore the focus of this volume. Diving into digital communications history, Finn Brunton brings to the fore the alienness of computational communication by looking at network timekeeping, automated trolling, and early attempts at communication with extraterrestrial life. Picking up this fascination with inhuman communication, Mercedes Bunz then performs a close reading of interaction design and interfaces to show how technology addresses humans (as very young children). Finally, Paula Bialski shares her findings from a field study of software development, analyzing the communicative forms that occur when code is written by separate people. Today, communication unfolds merely between two or more conscious entities but often includes an invisible third party. Inspired by this drastic shift, this volume uncovers new meanings of what it means “to communicate.”\n\n\nMachine\n\nAuthor: Thomas Patrick Pringle\nAuthor: Gertrud Koch\nAuthor: Bernard Stiegler\nLüneburg: meson press, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1488\nIn contrast with media constructed as vast, ontologically homogeneous, non-localized systems, formats show material networks of interoperability and exclusions, inscribed in local specificities, and involving precise conditions for the circulation of images and sounds. Formats, institutionalized as standards, frame the “technical networks” defined by Gilbert Simondon, that unfold technical objects into economically and politically structured webs that cover the world. Media are always formatted and, as such, do not flow: they are displaced."

And yet this power seems incomprehensible: understood as code, it becomes apolitical; understood as a totality, it becomes overwhelming. This book takes an alternate approach, using it to unravel the operations of Uber and Palantir, Airbnb and Amazon Alexa. Moving off the whiteboard and into the world, the algorithmic must negotiate with frictions—the ‘merely’ technical routines of distributing data and running tasks coming together into broader social forces that shape subjectivities, steer bodies, and calibrate relationships. Driven by the imperatives of capital, the algorithmic exhausts subjects and spaces, a double move seeking to both exhaustively apprehend them and exhaust away their productivities. But these on-the-ground encounters also reveal that force is never guaranteed. The irreducibility of the world renders logic inadequate and control gives way to contingency.\n\n\nPattern Discrimination\n\nAuthor: Hito Steyerl\nAuthor: Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\nAuthor: Clemens Apprich\nAuthor: Florian Cramer\nLüneburg: meson press, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1457\nAlgorithmic identity politics reinstate old forms of social segregation—in a digital world, identity politics is pattern discrimination. It is by recognizing patterns in input data that Artificial Intelligence algorithms create bias and practice racial exclusions thereby inscribing power relations into media. How can we filter information out of data without reinserting racist, sexist, and classist beliefs?"

This possibility has been attracting various scenarios in which technology either eliminates non-knowledge or plants it deep within contemporary cultures through the universal power and opacity of algorithms.

Dabei gewinnt die in den 1970er Jahren von James Lovelock gemeinsam mit Lynn Margulis entwickelte Gaia-Theorie heute neue Erklärungskraft. Wenn Gaia bei Bruno Latour sogar zum allgemeinen Modell der Welterklärung im 21. Jahrhundert wird, gilt es, nach der Plausibilität zu fragen, die die Rede von Gaia aktuell entwickelt. Die vier Beiträge des Bandes geben hierauf eine Antwort, indem sie die metaphorologischen und begriffshistorischen Linien der Gaia-Theorie nachzeichnen und ihren Bezug auf zeitgenössische Computersimulationen in den Blick nehmen. So wird der gegenwärtige Ort des Wiederauflebens Gaias deutlich – und damit die Verschränkung von kybernetischen und organizistischen Ökologien mit der Annahme einer Programmierbarkeit von Umgebungen.\n\n\nUnterwachen und Schlafen: Anthropophile Medien nach dem Interface\n\nAuthor: Suzana Alpsancar\nAuthor: Kevin Liggieri\nAuthor: Anna Tuschling\nEditor: Michael Andreas\nEditor: Dawid Kasprowicz\nEditor: Stefan Rieger\nLüneburg: meson press, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1358\nAnthropophile Medien durchdringen zunehmend unsere lebensweltliche Realität, sei es im Ambient Assisted Living, als Pflegeassistenzsysteme, in den Arbeitsszenarien einer Industrie 4.0, als behagliche Interfaces des Affective Computing oder als Lifetracker der Quantified-Self-Bewegung. Verbunden ist damit der Einzug menschlicher Befindlichkeiten, Werte und sozialer Routinen in das Design medialer Agencies. Über 40 Jahre nach dem Erscheinen von Michel Foucaults “Surveiller et punir” gerät damit auch dessen Kritikbegriff ins Wanken. An die Stelle von “Überwachen und Strafen” tritt “Unterwachen und Schlafen”. Unterwachen und Schlafen stellt nicht das theoretische Programm einer vollautomatisierten Lebenswelt in Aussicht, sondern das Konstrukt einer nunmehr medialen Umsetzung anthropologischer Grundelemente wie Autonomie, Freiheit oder Vertrauen."

For scientific endeavors such as the detection of gravitational waves and the exploration of subatomic worlds, simulations are essential; however, the epistemic status of computer simulations is rather controversial as they are neither just theory nor just experiment. Therefore, computer simulations have challenged well-established insights and common scientific practices as well as our very understanding of knowledge. This volume contributes to the ongoing discussion on the epistemic position of computer simulations in a variety of physical disciplines, such as quantum optics, quantum mechanics, and computational physics. Originating from an interdisciplinary event, it shows that accounts of contemporary physics can constructively interfere with media theory, philosophy, and the history of science."

Day-to-day politics are largely driven by economic lobbies in the interest of what Habermas calls their „generalised particularism,“ the threat to take jobs and tax revenues elsewhere. Citizens’ influence over politicians is twofold: they are asked for their input in elections, referenda, online consultations and surveys, and citizens can initiate issues where they see political action needed. Yet these “participative forces,” including NGOs, street rallies and charities, regularly fail to reach the ears of elected politicians as effectively as those of well-funded corporate lobbies. Also, this type of voluntary engagement often falls short of presenting the kind of reasoned challenges to the incumbents—by the electorate—that Habermas’ communicative action aimed at. A more powerful model would therefore organise the efforts of the electorate in a way that both generates those reasoned arguments, which, as Habermas quite correctly pointed out differ from mere opinions, and delivers them to the elected politicians in a manner they can neither refuse nor ignore. This is what the Citizen Lobby intends to do."

Marx famously declared that philosophers had only interpreted the world, but the point was to change it. Heidegger on his part stressed that our modern malaise was due to the forgetting of being, for which he thought technological questions were central. Following from his study of Marx as a thinker of technology, and foreseeing debates about globalization, Axelos recognizes that technology now determines the world. Providing an introduction to some of his major themes, including the play of the world, Axelos asks if planetary technology requires a new, a future way of thought which in itself is planetary.\n\n\nAlleys of Your Mind: Augmented Intelligence and Its Traumas\n\nAuthor: Charles T.

In the first essay, Barthélémy delivers a contemporary interpretation of Simondon’s concept of ontogenesis against the backdrop of biology and cybernetics. In the second essay, he extends his reflections to propose a non-anthropological understanding of technology, and so sets up a confrontation with the work of Martin Heidegger.\n\n\nDigital Activism in Asia Reader\n\nAuthor: Hu Yong\nAuthor: Merlyna Lim\nAuthor: Sarah McKeever\nAuthor: Prabhas Pokharel\nAuthor: Nandini Chami\nAuthor: Anat Ben-David\nAuthor: Htaike Htaike Aung\nAuthor: Maesy Angelina\nAuthor: Tracey Cheng\nAuthor: Armand Hurault\nAuthor: Rachael Jolley\nAuthor: Youngmi Kim\nAuthor: Subhashish Panigrahi\nAuthor: Puthiya Purayil Sneha\nAuthor: Padmini Ray Murray\nAuthor: Urvashi Sarkar\nAuthor: Shobha S V\nAuthor: YiPing Zona Tsou\nAuthor: Huma Yusuf\nAuthor: Weiyu Zhang\nAuthor: Denisse Albornoz\nAuthor: Esra’a Al Shafei\nEditor: Puthiya Purayil Sneha\nEditor: Sumandro Chattapadhyay\nEditor: Nishant Shah\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/013\nThe digital turn might as well be marked as an Asian turn. From flash-mobs in Taiwan to feminist mobilisations in India, from hybrid media strategies of Syrian activists to cultural protests in Thailand, we see the emergence of political acts that transform the citizen from being a beneficiary of change to becoming an agent of change. In co-shaping these changes, what the digital shall be used for, and what its consequences will be, are both up for speculation and negotiation. Digital Activism in Asia marks a particular shift where these questions are no longer being refracted through the ICT4D logic, or the West’s attempts to save Asia from itself, but shaped by multiplicity, unevenness, and urgencies of digital sites and users in Asia. This reader crowd-sources critical tools, concepts, analyses, and annotations, self-identified by a network of change makers in Asia as important in their own practices within their own contexts.\n\n\nThe Political Structure of UK Broadcasting 1949–1999\n\nAuthor: David Elstein\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/011\nIn 1999 David Elstein delivered a lecture series examining the evolvement of UK Broadcasting policy from 1949 to 1999.

Today’s games can simulate battlefields, predict disaster, and crash markets. We are faced with a diversity of play and the ubiquity of games, making them not only a popular medium, but the leading medium of our contemporary society. Based on the keynote lectures held at DiGRA2015, “Diversity of Play” provides a critical view on the current stage of digital games from a theoretic, artistic, and practical perspective by pointing towards the uncanny, the power of “unnatural” narratives, and the exceptions and uncertainties of digital ludic environments.

As hero of the cyberpunk epic, in its brief but intense history, the cyborg has followed and anticipated the rapport and conflict between man and machine.\nIn the post-fordist era of digital networked media the cyborg unfolds itself in the dissemination of multiple bodies: on the Internet, in the shift of individual identity, in the new collective aggregation connected by software. It bridges virtuality and concreteness, possibility and necessity. The cyborg thus becomes a field of social conflict, one of the new figures in which the bio-political perspective is embodied.\n\n\n30 Years After Les Immatériaux: Art, Science and Theory\n\nAuthor: Sven-Olov Wallenstein\nAuthor: Anne Elisabeth Sejten\nAuthor: Bernard Stiegler\nAuthor: Jean-Louis Boissier\nAuthor: Daniel Birnbaum\nAuthor: Thierry Dufrêne\nAuthor: Francesca Gallo\nAuthor: Charlie Gere\nAuthor: Antony Hudek\nAuthor: Jean-François Lyotard\nAuthor: Robin Mackay\nEditor: Yuk Hui\nEditor: Andreas Broeckmann\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/002\nIn 1985, the French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard curated a groundbreaking exhibition called Les Immatériaux at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The exhibition showed how telecommunication technologies were beginning to impact every aspect of life. At the same time, it was a material demonstration of what Lyotard called the post-modern condition. This book features a previously unpublished report by Jean-François Lyotard on the conception of Les Immatériaux and its relation to postmodernity. Reviewing the historical significance of the exhibition, his text is accompanied by twelve contemporary meditations. The philosophers, art historians, and artists analyse this important moment in the history of media and theory, and reflect on the new material conditions brought about by digital technologies in the last 30 years.\n\n\nDie verschiedenen Modi der Existenz\n\nAuthor: Étienne Souriau\nTranslator: Thomas Wäckerle\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/003\n„Wäre die Philosophie auch nur eine Stunde der Mühe wert, wenn sie uns nicht für das Leben rüstete?“ Gezielten Schrittes entwirft der französische Philosoph Étienne Souriau in diesem dicht gedrängten Buch eine Grammatik der Existenz. Im Fokus steht nicht nur ihre Theorie, sondern auch die tatsächliche Ausübung der „Kunst des Existierens“. Wie Gilles Deleuze und William James vertritt Souriau dabei die These eines existenziellen Pluralismus: Es gibt Phänomene, Dinge, das Virtuelle, fiktionale Wesen – die Existenz ist polyphon. Souriaus radikale Herangehensweise hat auch Bruno Latour und Isabelle Stengers entscheidend beeinflusst. In ihrer ausführlichen Einleitung zu Souriaus Text von 1943 und dem ebenfalls zum ersten Mal in deutscher Sprache veröffentlichten Vortrag „Über den Modus der Existenz des zu vollbringenden Werks“ (1956) zeigt sich eindrucksvoll die Aktualität seines Denkens.\n\n\nPolitik der Mikroentscheidungen: Edward Snowden, Netzneutralität und die Architekturen des Internets\n\nAuthor: Florian Sprenger\nForeword by: Christopher Kelty\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/004\nOb beim Aufrufen einer Webseite, beim Versenden einer E-Mail oder beim Hochfrequenzhandel an der Börse: Auf ihrem Weg durch die Weiten digitaler Netze durchqueren Bits zahlreiche Knoten, an denen eine Reihe von Mikroentscheidungen getroffen werden. Diese Entscheidungen betreffen den besten Pfad zum Ziel, die Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit oder die Priorität zwischen den ankommenden Paketen.\nIn ihrer vielschichtigen Gestalt bilden solche Mikroentscheidungen eine bislang nur marginal beachtete Dimension von Kontrolle und Überwachung im 21. Jahrhundert. Sie sind sowohl die kleinste Einheit als auch die technische Voraussetzung einer gegenwärtigen Politik digitaler Netzwerke – und des Widerstands gegen sie. Die aktuellen Debatten um Netzneutralität und Edward Snowdens Enthüllung der NSA-Überwachung bilden dabei lediglich die Spitze des Eisbergs. Auf dem Spiel steht nicht weniger als die Zukunft des Internets, wie wir es kennen.\n\n\nThe Politics of Micro-Decisions: Edward Snowden, Net Neutrality, and the Architectures of the Internet\n\nAuthor: Florian Sprenger\nTranslator: Valentine A. Pakis\nForeword by: Christopher Kelty\nLüneburg: meson press, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/005\nBe it in the case of opening a website, sending an email, or high-frequency trading, bits and bytes of information have to cross numerous nodes at which micro-decisions are made. These decisions concern the most efficient path through the network, the processing speed, or the priority of incoming data packets.\nDespite their multifaceted nature, micro-decisions are a dimension of control and surveillance in the twenty-first century that has received little critical attention. They represent the smallest unit and the technical precondition of a contemporary network politics – and of our potential opposition to it. The current debates regarding net neutrality and Edward Snowden’s revelation of NSA surveillance are only the tip of the iceberg. What is at stake is nothing less than the future of the Internet as we know it."

Pollution, the poison of pesticides, the exhaustion of natural resources, falling water tables, growing social inequalities – these are all problems that can no longer be treated separately. The effects of global warming have a cumulative impact, and it is not a matter of a crisis that will “pass” before everything goes back to “normal.”\nOur governments are totally incapable of dealing with the situation. Economic warfare obliges them to stick to the goal of irresponsible, even criminal, economic growth, whatever the cost. It is no surprise that people were so struck by the catastrophe in New Orleans. The response of the authorities – to abandon the poor whilst the rich were able to take shelter – is a symbol of the coming barbarism."

It describes the permeation of economic, political, and social contexts by game-elements such as awards, rule structures, and interfaces that are inspired by video games. Sometimes the term is reduced to the implementation of points, badges, and leaderboards as incentives and motivations to be productive. Sometimes it is envisioned as a universal remedy to deeply transform society toward more humane and playful ends. Despite its use by corporations to manage brand communities and personnel, however, gamification is more than just a marketing buzzword. States are beginning to use it as a new tool for governing populations more effectively. It promises to fix what is wrong with reality by making every single one of us fitter, happier, and healthier. Indeed, it seems like all of society is up for being transformed into one massive game.\nThe contributions in this book offer a candid assessment of the gamification hype. They trace back the historical roots of the phenomenon and explore novel design practices and methods. They critically discuss its social implications and even present artistic tactics for resistance. It is time to rethink gamification!"

The experiences of academics affected by conflict remain under-researched, despite the crucial role they play as educators and in generating, documenting, preserving and challenging knowledges. This is particularly concerning given that academics have−and continue to be−at risk as targets of sanction, persecution and oppression."

It challenges the biases and prejudices inherent within uninformed histories of mathematics, including problems of white supremacy, the denial of cultural difference and the global homogenization of teaching methods. In particular, the book contrasts the effectiveness of mathematics and science in modelling physical phenomena and solving technical problems with its ineffectiveness in modelling social phenomena and solving human problems, and urges us to consider how mathematics might better meet the urgent crises of our age.\n\n\nInvesting in the Structural Transformation: 2024 European Public Investment Outlook\n\nEditor: Floriana Cerniglia\nEditor: Francesco Saraceno\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0434\nThe fifth volume in the European Public Investment Outlook series explores how Europe can drive structural transformation through strategic public investment.

This means that what one knows is influenced not just by belief, evidence, and truth, but crucially by the purposes those beliefs serve. Drawing from classical Nyāya epistemologies, the book asserts that knowledge rationalizes action: if you know something, it is sensible to act on it—and the best way to square this with an anti-sceptical epistemology is to say that knowledge is interest-relative.\n\n\nNo Prices No Games!: Four Economic Models\n\nAuthor: Michael Richter\nAuthor: Ariel Rubinstein\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0438\nWhile current economic theory focuses on prices and games, this book models economic settings where harmony is established through one of the following societal conventions:\n• A power relation according to which stronger agents are able to force weaker ones to do things against their will. • A norm that categorizes actions as permissible or forbidden. • A status relation over alternatives which limits each agent’s choices. • Systematic biases in agents’ preferences.\nThese four conventions are analysed using simple and mathematically straightforward models, without any pretensions regarding direct applied usefulness. While we do not advocate for the adoption of any of these conventions specifically – we do advocate that when modelling an economic situation, alternative equilibrium notions should be considered, rather than automatically reaching for the familiar approaches of prices or games.\n\n\nDiachronic Diversity in Classical Biblical Hebrew\n\nAuthor: Aaron D. Hornkohl\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0433\nAccording to the standard periodisation of ancient Hebrew, the division of Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the Masoretic tradition is basically dichotomous: pre-exilic Classical Biblical Hebrew (CBH) versus post-Restoration Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH). Within this paradigm, the chronolectal unity of CBH is rarely questioned—this despite the reasonable expectation that the language of a corpus encompassing traditions of various ages and comprising works composed, edited, and transmitted over the course of centuries would show signs of diachronic development. From the perspective of historical evolution, CBH is remarkably homogenous. Within this apparent uniformity, however, there are indeed signs of historical development, sets of alternant features whose respective concentrations seem to divide CBH into two sub-chronolects. The most conspicuous typological division that emerges is between the CBH of the Pentateuch and that of the relevant Prophets and Writings. The present volume investigates a series of features that distinguish the two ostensible CBH sub-chronolects, weighs alternative explanations for distribution patterns that appear to have chronological significance, and considers broader implications for Hebrew diachrony and periodisation and for the composition of the Torah.\n\n\nDigital Humanities in the India Rim: Contemporary Scholarship in Australia and India\n\nEditor: Myra Gurney\nEditor: Hart Cohen\nEditor: Ujjwal Jana\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0423\nThis varied collection delves into illuminating examples of Digital Humanities research and practice currently being undertaken by academics in India and Australia, and seeks to understand the shared challenges as well as the points of similarity and difference between them. From the influence of Netflix on International Relations to contemporary digital adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, via detours into erobotics (empathic robots) and the cultural specificity of online dating, these essays convey the distinctive breadth and imagination of research in this field.\nDigital Humanities is a relatively new discipline in the India Rim, and this novelty has created space for innovative research ideas, as well as the use of traditional methodologies and software in different ways within these unique cultural spaces that could potentially influence how Digital Humanities is conceptualised internationally.\n\n\nThe Struggle You Can’t See: Experiences of Neurodivergent and Invisibly Disabled Students in Higher Education\n\nAuthor: Ash Lierman\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0420\nThis book offers a comprehensive review of current research on the higher education experiences of neurodivergent undergraduate students and those with invisible disabilities. Grounded in principles of social justice and equity, this work draws from design thinking, the neurodiversity model, and Universal Design for Learning, to explore the context of higher education in relation to neurodivergent and disabled students."

The classic example of this fallacy, the first of Aristotle’s fallacies independent of language, is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know Coriscus, Coriscus is the one approaching, but you don’t know the one approaching since, e.g., he is wearing a mask. But Aristotle’s account is unclear and Segrave, building on ideas of Giles of Rome and Walter Burley, shows how the fallacy turns on an equivocation over the supposition of the middle term or one of the extremes in a syllogism. Thereby, Segrave is able to counter Bradwardine’s arguments one by one and defend the restrictivist solution. In this volume, Segrave’s text is edited from the three extant manuscripts, is translated into English, and is preceded by a substantial Introduction.\n\n\nDiversity across the Arabian Peninsula: Language, Culture, Nature\n\nEditor: Fabio Gasparini\nEditor: Kamala Russell\nEditor: Janet C.E.

This edited volume delves into why modern philosophical approaches to technology closely align with phenomenology and explores the implications of this relationship. Over the past two decades, scholars have emphasized users’ lived experiences and their interactions with technological practices, arguing that technologies gain meaning and shape within specific contexts, actively shaping those contexts in return. This book investigates the phenomenological roots of contemporary philosophy of technology, examining how phenomenology informs analyses of temporality, use, cognition, embodiment, and environmentality. Divided into three sections, the volume begins by exploring the role of phenomenological methods in the philosophy of technology, and further investigates the methodological implications of combining phenomenology with other philosophical schools. The second section examines technology as a phenomenon, debating whether it should be analysed as a whole or through individual artifacts. The final section addresses the practical applications of phenomenological insights in design practices and democratic engagement.\n\n\nGrotesque and Performance in the Art of Aubrey Beardsley\n\nAuthor: Evanghelia Stead\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0413\nThis insightful study illuminates previously unexplored aspects of Aubrey Beardsley’s relationship to the grotesque and his use of media, particularly his manipulation of the periodical press.

They are even basic to the textbooks on Biblical Hebrew. Being fundamental in the verbal system, and part of any beginner’s grammar, they pose a serious problem to a linguistic understanding of the verbal system, since grammars describe an alternation of ‘forms’ or ‘tenses’ in double pairs: wayyiqṭol alternates with its ‘equivalent’ qaṭal, and wə-qaṭal alternates with its ‘equivalent’ yiqṭol. This ‘enigma’ in the verbal system is handled in the book by recognising that the alternation of the consecutive tenses with other tenses, in the reality of the text, represents a linking of clauses. The ‘consecutive tenses’ are clause-types with a natural language connective wa- directly followed by a finite verbal morpheme, a type of clause that expressed continuity in the earliest stage of Semitic. The commonly held assumption that there is a special ‘consecutive waw’ is unwarranted. The use of the ‘consecutive’ clause-types in order to express discourse continuity indicates that Classical Hebrew has retained the old unmarked declarative word order of Semitic syntax. Seen in the light of recent research on the Tiberian reading tradition, the ‘consecutive’ wayyiqṭol can be analysed as a retention of the old Semitic past perfective *wa-yaqtul, which was pronounced wa-yiqṭol in Classical Hebrew. The ‘consecutive’ wə-qāṭal (pronounced wa-qaṭal in the classical language) constitutes the result of an internal Hebrew development into a construction (in the sense of Joan Bybee) already foreshadowed in the earliest Northwest Semitic languages. The book understands the ‘consecutive tenses’ as discourse continuity clauses, which typically form chains of main line clauses. Such chains can be interrupted by other types of clauses. This interruption is a clause linking that receives special attention in the interpretation of the Classical Hebrew verbal system. Chapter six presents a regenerated text linguistics founded on the new terminology.\n\n\nThe Last Years of Polish Jewry: Volume 2: The Permanent Pogrom, 1935–37\n\nAuthor: Yankev Leshchinsky\nEditor: Robert Brym\nTranslator: Eli Jany\nTranslator: Robert Brym\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0342\nUkrainian-born Yankev Leshchinsky (1876-1966) was the leading scholarly and journalistic analyst of Eastern European Jewish socioeconomic and political life from the 1920s to the 1950s. Known as “the dean of Jewish sociologists” and “the father of Jewish demography,” Leshchinsky published a series of insightful and moving essays in Yiddish on Polish Jewry between 1927 and 1937. Despite heightened interest in interwar Jewish communities in Poland in recent years, these essays (like most of Leshchinsky’s works) have never been translated into English.\n\n\nTouching Parchment: How Medieval Users Rubbed, Handled, and Kissed Their Manuscripts: Volume 2: Social Encounters with the Book\n\nAuthor: Kathryn M.

But what does this phrase actually entail, and what is its relevance today? How do citizens themselves experience, feel and respond to this ‘crisis’? Bitter-Sweet Democracy grapples with the complexities of these questions in the context of citizens’ relations to politics in Belgium—a nation that has experienced political instability and protests as well as social mobilization and democratic vitality in recent years.\n\n\nAugustus De Morgan, Polymath: New Perspectives on his Life and Legacy\n\nAuthor: Karen Attar\nAuthor: Adrian Rice\nAuthor: Christopher Stray\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0408\nWhen Augustus De Morgan died in 1871, he was described as ‘one of the profoundest mathematicians in the United Kingdom’ and even as ‘the greatest of our mathematicians’. But he was far more than just a mathematician. Because much of his voluminous written output on various subjects was scattered throughout journals and encyclopaedias, the breadth of his interests and contributions has been underappreciated by historians. Now, renewed interest in De Morgan’s life and work has coincided with the digitization of his extensive library, revealing the extent to which he pioneered and influenced the development of not merely mathematics but also logic, astronomy, the history of mathematics, education, and bibliography.\n\n\nTrix: The Other Kipling\n\nAuthor: Barbara Fisher\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0377\nThis volume represents the first biography of Alice MacDonald Kipling Fleming (1868-1948), known as Trix. Rarely portrayed with sympathy or accuracy in biographies of her famous brother Rudyard, Trix was a talented writer and a memorable character in her own right whose fascinating life was unknown until now. In telling Trix’s story, Barbara Fisher rescues her from the misrepresentations, trivializations, and outright neglect of Rudyard’s many biographers.\n\n\nAn Anthology of Global Risk\n\nEditor: SJ Beard\nEditor: Tom Hobson\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0360\nThis anthology brings together a diversity of key texts in the emerging field of Existential Risk Studies. It serves to complement the previous volume The Era of Global Risk: An Introduction to Existential Risk Studies by providing open access to original research and insights in this rapidly evolving field. At its heart, this book highlights the ongoing development of new academic paradigms and theories of change that have emerged from a community of researchers in and around the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. The chapters in this book challenge received notions of human extinction and civilization collapse and seek to chart new paths towards existential security and hope."

By means of a philological and literary analysis, Morales-Harley hypothesizes that Greco-Roman literature was known, understood, and recreated in India. Moreover, it is argued that the techniques for adapting epic into theater could have been Greco-Roman influences in India, and that some of the elements adapted within the literary motifs (specifically the motifs of the embassy, the ambush, and the ogre) could have been Greco-Roman borrowings by Sanskrit authors.\n\n\nAn Annotated Corpus of Three Hundred Proverbs, Sayings, and Idioms in Eastern Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t\n\nAuthor: Giuliano Castagna\nContributions by: Suhail al-Amri\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0422\nThis book explores the rich paremiological heritage of Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t, an endangered pre-literate language belonging to the Modern South Arabian sub-branch of Semitic, spoken by an ever-decreasing number of people in the Dhofar governorate of the Sultanate of Oman.\n\n\nThinking Blue / Writing Red: Marxism and the (Post)Human\n\nAuthor: Stephen Tumino\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0324\nThinking Blue/Writing Red interrogates contemporary culture across a range of texts, from the pandemic (‘Covid’ and ‘Trump Speak’) to high theory (Melville’s narratives) and popular culture (Beyoncé’s ‘Formation’ and Super Bowl performance, Twin Peaks , metamodern ‘cli-fi’ films).\n\n\nEtosha Pan to the Skeleton Coast: Conservation Histories, Policies and Practices in North-west Namibia\n\nEditor: Sian Sullivan\nEditor: Ute Dieckmann\nEditor: Selma Lendelvo\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0402\nEtosha Pan to the Skeleton Coast examines the conservation histories and concerns of one of southern Africa’s most iconic conservation regions: the variously connected ‘Etosha-Kunene’ areas of north-central and north-west Namibia. This cross-disciplinary volume brings together contributions from a Namibian and international group of scholars and conservation practitioners, working on topics ranging from colonial histories to water management, perceptions of ‘wildlife’ and the politics of belonging. Together, these essays confront a critical question: how can the conservation of biodiversity-rich landscapes be reconciled with historical injustices of social exclusion and marginalisation?"

Since their establishment as scientific tools for classification in the eighteenth century, diagrams have been used to determine but also to deny kinship between human groups. In nineteenth-century craniometry, they were omnipresent in attempts to standardize measurements on skulls for hierarchical categorization. In particular the ’human family tree’ was central for evolutionary understandings of human diversity, being used on both sides of debates about whether humans constitute different species well into the twentieth century. With recent advances in (ancient) DNA analyses, the tree diagram has become more contested than ever―does human relatedness take the shape of a network? Are human individual genomes mosaics made up of different ancestries? Sommer examines the epistemic and political role of these visual representations in the history of ‘race’ as an anthropological category. How do such diagrams relate to imperial and (post-)colonial practices and ideologies but also to liberal and humanist concerns?"

In listening to music, we are drawn to dimensions of human experience beyond the material. This collection brings together leading scholars from various disciplines – including Christian theology, musicology, and psychology and neuroscience – to interrogate the intimate relationship between music and spirituality.\n\n\nAntisemitism in Online Communication: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Hate Speech in the Twenty-First Century\n\nEditor: Laura Ascone\nEditor: Karolina Placzynta\nEditor: Chloé Vincent\nEditor: Matthias J.

Contributors explore various facets of online antisemitism, including its intersectionality with misogyny and its dissemination through memes and social networks. Through case studies, they examine the reproduction, support, and rejection of antisemitic tropes, alongside quantitative assessments of comment structures in online discussions. Additionally, the volume delves into the capabilities of content moderation tools and deep-learning models for automated hate speech detection. This multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive understanding of contemporary antisemitism in digital spaces, recognising the importance of addressing its insidious spread from multiple angles.\n\n\nThe Life of Nuns: Love, Politics, and Religion in Medieval German Convents\n\nAuthor: Eva Schlotheuber\nAuthor: Henrike Lähnemann\nTranslator: Anne Simon\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0397\nIn the Middle Ages half of those who chose the religious life were women, yet historians have overlooked entire generations of educated, feisty, capable and enterprising nuns, condemning them to the dusty silence of the archives. What, though, were their motives for entering a convent and what was their daily routine behind its walls like? How did they think, live and worship, both as individuals and as a community? How did they maintain contact with the families and communities they had left behind? Henrike Lähnemann and Eva Schlotheuber offer readers a vivid insight into the largely unknown lives and work of religious women in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\n\nPsychological Perspectives on Musical Experiences and Skills: Research in the Western Balkans and Western Europe\n\nEditor: Blanka Bogunović\nEditor: Renee Timmers\nEditor: Sanela Nikolić\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0389\nThis book features recent research on the psychology of music from the Western Balkans, foregrounding its specific topics, methods, and influences by bringing it into productive conversation with complementary research from Western Europe and further afield.\n\n\nHuman Evolutionary Demography\n\nEditor: Oskar Burger\nEditor: Ronald Lee\nEditor: Rebecca Sear\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0251\nHuman evolutionary demography is an emerging field blending natural science with social science.

Munro): Original and Uncollected Stories\n\nEditor: Bruce Gaston\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0365\nThe short stories of Hector Hugh Munro, better known by his pen name Saki, have remained in print continuously for over a hundred years. This collection is the first of its kind to present his stories as they were originally published in newspapers and magazines, preserving their internal consistency and contemporary references lost in revisions for The Chronicles of Clovis and subsequent collected editions. A trove of annotations and carefully sourced bibliographical information illuminates the Edwardian context behind the thirteen selected stories, of which three (‘Mrs. Pendercoet’s Lost Identity’, ‘The Romance of Business’ and ‘The Optimist’) were only recently rediscovered."

The addressees of the law text must revere their parents, respect the elderly, fear God, take care of their fellow, provide for the sojourner, and so on. The sojourner has his own obligations, as do the priests. Even God is said to behave in various ways towards various persons.

D. Saull and his Museum of Evolution\n\nAuthor: Adrian Desmond\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0393\nIn the 1830s, decades before Darwin published the Origin of Species, a museum of evolution flourished in London. Reign of the Beast pieces together the extraordinary story of this lost working-man’s institution and its enigmatic owner, the wine merchant W. D. Saull. A financial backer of the anti-clerical Richard Carlile, the ‘Devil’s Chaplain’ Robert Taylor, and socialist Robert Owen, Saull outraged polite society by putting humanity’s ape ancestry on display. He weaponized his museum fossils and empowered artisans with a knowledge of deep geological time that undermined the Creationist base of the Anglican state. His geology museum, called the biggest in Britain, housed over 20,000 fossils, including famous dinosaurs. Saull was indicted for blasphemy and reviled during his lifetime. After his death in 1855, his museum was demolished and he was expunged from the collective memory. Now multi-award-winning author Adrian Desmond undertakes a thorough reading of Home Office spy reports and subversive street prints to re-establish Saull’s pivotal place at the intersection of the history of geology, atheism, socialism, and working-class radicalism.\n\n\nArabic Documents from Medieval Nubia\n\nAuthor: Geoffrey Khan\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0391\nThis volume presents an edition of a corpus of Arabic documents data-ble to the 11th and 12th centuries AD that were discovered by the Egypt Exploration Society at the site of the Nubian fortress Qaṣr Ibrīm (situated in the south of modern Egypt).\n\n\nJesus and the Making of the Modern Mind, 1380-1520\n\nAuthor: Luke Clossey\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0371\nFor his fifteenth-century followers, Jesus was everywhere – from baptism to bloodcults to bowling. This sweeping and unconventional investigation looks at Jesus across one hundred forty years of social, cultural, and intellectual history. Mystics married him, Renaissance artists painted him in three dimensions, Muslim poets praised his life-giving breath, and Christopher (“Christ-bearing”) Columbus brought the symbol of his cross to the Americas. Beyond the European periphery, this global study follows Jesus across – and sometimes between – religious boundaries, from Greenland to Kongo to China."

What can childhood memories tell us about state socialism and its aftermath? How can these intimate memories complicate history and redefine possible futures? These questions are at the heart of the (An)Archive: Childhood, Memory, and the Cold War. This edited collection stems from a collaboration between academics and artists who came together to collectively remember their own experiences of growing up on both sides of the ‘Iron Curtain’. Looking beyond official historical archives, the book gathers memories that have been erased or forgotten, delegitimized or essentialized, or, at best, reinterpreted nostalgically within the dominant frameworks of the East-West divide. And it reassembles and (re)stores these childhood memories in a form of an ‘anarchive’: a site for merging, mixing, connecting, but also juxtaposing personal experiences, public memory, political rhetoric, places, times, and artifacts. Collectively, these acts and arts of collective remembering tell about possible futures―and the past’s futures―what life during the Cold War might have been but also what it has become.\n\n\nA Grammar of the Jewish Arabic Dialect of Gabes\n\nAuthor: Wiktor Gębski\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0394\nThis volume undertakes a linguistic exploration of the endangered Arabic dialect spoken by the Jews of Gabes, a coastal city situated in Southern Tunisia. Belonging to the category of sedentary North African dialects, this variety is now spoken by a dwindling number of native speakers, primarily in Israel and France. Given the imminent extinction faced by many modern varieties of Judaeo-Arabic, including Jewish Gabes, the study’s primary goal is to document and describe its linguistic nuances while reliable speakers are still accessible. Data for this comprehensive study were collected during fieldwork in Israel and France between December 2018 and March 2022.\n\n\nTangible and Intangible Heritage in the Age of Globalisation\n\nEditor: Lilia Makhloufi\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0388\nTangible and Intangible Heritage in the Age of Globalisation offers a rich collection of perspectives on the complex interplay between tangible and intangible heritage. These essays illustrate the need to redefine heritage as an interdisciplinary and intercultural concept. They interrogate heritage paradigms while also providing concrete recommendations to promote the preservation of physical heritage spaces, and the cultural practices and social relationships that depend on them.\n\n\nHeavy Metal: Earth’s Minerals and the Future of Sustainable Societies\n\nEditor: Philippe D.

This volume aims to provoke new debate about the continued currency of Russian literature as symbolic capital for international readers, in particular for nations seeking to create or consolidate cultural and political leverage in the so-called ‘World Republic of Letters’. It also seeks to examine and contrast the mechanisms of the translation and uses of Russian literature across the globe."

Prismatic Jane Eyre argues that we should see these many re-writings, not as simple replications of the novel, but as a release of its multiple interpretative possibilities: in other words, as a prism.\n\n\nMisunderstandings: False Beliefs in Communication\n\nAuthor: Georg Weizsäcker\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0367\nWhat do we expect when we say something to someone, and what do they expect when they hear it? When is a conversation successful? The book considers a wide set of two-person conversations, and a bit of game theory, to show how conversational statements and their interpretations are governed by beliefs. Thinking about beliefs is suitable for communication analysis because beliefs are well-defined and measurable, allowing to differentiate between successful understandings and their less successful counterparts: misunderstandings."

It addresses the need to set new values for universities, trapped today in narratives dominated by financial incentives and performance indicators, and examines those “wicked” problems which need multiple solutions, resolutions, experiments, and imaginaries.\n\n\nThe Predatory Paradox: Ethics, Politics, and Practices in Contemporary Scholarly Publishing\n\nAuthor: Amy Koerber\nAuthor: Jesse C. Starkey\nAuthor: Karin Ardon-Dryer\nAuthor: R. Glenn Cummins\nAuthor: Lyombe Eko\nAuthor: Kerk F. Kee\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0364\nIn today’s ‘publish or perish’ academic setting, the institutional prizing of quantity over quality has given rise to and perpetuated the dilemma of predatory publishing. Upon a close examination, however, the definition of ‘predatory’ itself becomes slippery, evading neat boxes or lists which might seek to easily define and guard against it. This volume serves to foreground a nuanced representation of this multifaceted issue. In such a rapidly evolving landscape, this book becomes a field guide to its historical, political, and economic aspects, presenting thoughtful interviews, legal analysis and original research. Case studies from both European-American and non-European-American stakeholders emphasize the worldwide nature of the challenge faced by researchers of all levels.\n\n\nTransparent Minds in Science Fiction: An Introduction to Alien, AI and Post-Human Consciousness\n\nAuthor: Paul Matthews\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0348\nTransparent Minds explores the intersection between neuroscience and science fiction stories. Paul Matthews expertly analyses the narratives of humans and nonhumans from Mary Shelley to Kazuo Ishiguro across 200 years of the genre. In doing so he gives lucid insight into the meaning of existence and self-awareness. Rigorously researched and highly accessible, Matthews argues that psycho-emotional science fiction writers both imitate and inform alien and post-human consciousnesses through exploratory narratives and metaphor.\n\n\nShépa: The Tibetan Oral Tradition in Choné\n\nAuthor: Members of the Choné Tibetan Community\nAuthor: Bendi Tso\nAuthor: Marnyi Gyatso\nAuthor: Mark Turin\nAuthor: Naljor Tsering\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0312\nThis book contains a unique collection of Tibetan oral narrations and songs known as Shépa, as these have been performed, recorded and shared between generations of Choné Tibetans from Amdo living in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Presented in trilingual format — in Tibetan, Chinese and English — the book reflects a sustained collaboration with and between members of the local community, including narrators, monks, and scholars, calling attention to the diversity inherent in all oral traditions, and the mutability of Shépa in particular."

Farmer offers a unique insight into A39’s creation, operation, and artistic practice during a period of convulsive political and social change.\n\n\nLinguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\n\nEditor: Elizabeth Robar\nEditor: William A. Ross\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358\nThis volume is the result of the 2021 session of the Linguistics and the Biblical Text research group of the Institute for Biblical Research, which addresses the history, relevance, and prospects of broad theoretical linguistic frameworks in the field of biblical studies. Cognitive Linguistics, Functional Grammar, generative linguistics, historical linguistics, complexity theory, and computational analysis are each allotted a chapter, outlining the key theoretical commitments of each approach, their major concepts and/or methods, and their important contributions to contemporary study of the biblical text.\n\n\nToevallige ontmoetingen: Bio-ethiek voor een gehavende planeet\n\nAuthor: Kristien Hens\nIllustrator: Christina Stadlbauer\nIllustrator: Bart H.M. Vandeput\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0370\nIn dit rigoureuze en noodzakelijke boek brengt Kristien Hens bio-ethiek en filosofie van de biologie bij elkaar, met het argument dat het ethisch noodzakelijk is om in het wetenschappelijk onderzoek een plaatsje vrij te houden voor de filosofen. Hun rol is behalve ethisch ook conceptueel: zij kunnen de kwaliteit en de coherentie van het wetenschappelijk onderzoek verbeteren door erop toe te zien dat specifieke concepten op een consistente en doordachte manier worden gebruik binnen interdisciplinaire projecten. Hens argumenteert dat toeval en onzekerheid een centrale rol spelen in de bio-ethiek, maar dat die in een spanningsrelatie kunnen raken met de pogingen om bepaalde theorieën ingang te doen vinden als wetenschappelijke kennis: bij het beschrijven van organismen en praktijken creëren we op een bepaalde manier de wereld. Hens stelt dat dit noodzakelijk een ethische activiteit betreft.\n\n\nEthics of Socially Disruptive Technologies: An Introduction\n\nEditor: Ibo van de Poel\nEditor: Jeroen Hopster\nEditor: Behnam Taebi\nEditor: Lily Eva Frank\nEditor: Julia Hermann\nEditor: Dominic Lenzi\nEditor: Sven Nyholm\nEditor: Elena Ziliotti\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0366\nTechnologies shape who we are, how we organize our societies and how we relate to nature. For example, social media challenges democracy; artificial intelligence raises the question of what is unique to humans; and the possibility to create artificial wombs may affect notions of motherhood and birth. Some have suggested that we address global warming by engineering the climate, but how does this impact our responsibility to future generations and our relation to nature? This book shows how technologies can be socially and conceptually disruptive and investigates how to come to terms with this disruptive potential.\n\n\nCheap Print and Street Literature of the Long Eighteenth Century\n\nEditor: David Atkinson\nEditor: Steve Roud\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0347\nThis deeply researched collection offers a comprehensive introduction to the eighteenth-century trade in street literature – ballads, chapbooks, and popular prints – in England and Scotland. Offering detailed studies of a selection of the printers, types of publication, and places of publication that constituted the cheap and popular print trade during the period, these essays delve into ballads, slip songs, story books, pictures, and more to push back against neat divisions between low and high culture, or popular and high literature."

His career extended from the Arts and Crafts movement of the late Victorian age to the Austerity aesthetics of the Second World War. Rejecting mass production and patronised by Royalty, Moorcroft’s work was a synthesis of studio and factory, art and industry. He considered it his vocation to create an everyday art, both functional and decorative, affordable by more than a privileged few: ‘If only the people in the world would concentrate upon making all things beautiful, and if all people concentrated on developing the arts of Peace, what a world it might be,’ he wrote in a letter to his daughter in 1930.\n\n\nThe Linguistic Classification of the Reading Traditions of Biblical Hebrew: A Phyla-and-Waves Model\n\nAuthor: Benjamin Paul Kantor\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0210\nIn recent decades, the field of Biblical Hebrew philology and linguistics has been witness to a growing interest in the diverse traditions of Biblical Hebrew. Indeed, while there is a tendency for many students and scholars to conceive of Biblical Hebrew as equivalent with the Tiberian pointing of the Leningrad Codex as it appears in Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), there are many other important reading traditions attested throughout history.\n\n\nThe Era of Global Risk: An Introduction to Existential Risk Studies\n\nEditor: SJ Beard\nEditor: Martin Rees\nEditor: Catherine Richards\nEditor: Clarissa Rios Rojas\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0336\nThis innovative and comprehensive collection of essays explores the biggest threats facing humanity in the 21st century; threats that cannot be contained or controlled and that have the potential to bring about human extinction and civilization collapse. Bringing together experts from many disciplines, it provides an accessible survey of what we know about these threats, how we can understand them better, and most importantly what can be done to manage them effectively.\n\n\nA Relational Realist Vision for Education Policy and Practice\n\nAuthor: Basem Adi\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0327\nThis volume argues that relational realism can help us to make better educational policy that is more effective in practice. Basem Adi draws on critical realism to thoroughly re-examine fundamental assumptions about how government policymaking works, developing an ontological basis from which to examine existing government approaches and imagine an alternative approach based on a relational realist-informed critical pedagogy.\n\n\nResearch, Writing, and Creative Process in Open and Distance Education: Tales from the Field\n\nEditor: Dianne Conrad\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0356\nThis collection of reflective essays is a treasure trove of advice, reflection and hard-won experience from experts in the field of open and distance education. Each chapter offers tried-and-tested advice for nascent academic writers, delivered with personal, rich, and wonderful stories of the authors’ careers, their process, their research and their writing, and the struggles and triumphs they have encountered in the course of their careers.\n\n\nSeabirds in the North-East Atlantic: Climate Change Vulnerability and Potential Conservation Actions\n\nAuthor: Henry Häkkinen\nAuthor: Silviu O.

This misconception can often lead to disarray and costly mistakes. Digital Transformation: Understanding Business Goals, Risks, Processes, and Decisions shows how to avoid such issues via careful consideration of what an enterprise really needs."

John Isbell provides an essential collection that illuminates the impact women writers had on French literature and politics during a time marked by three revolutions, the influx of Romantic art, and rapid technological change.\n\n\nBreaking Conventions: Five Couples in Search of Marriage-Career Balance at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century\n\nAuthor: Patricia Auspos\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0318\nThis rich history illuminates the lives and partnerships of five married couples – two British, three American – whose unions defied the conventions of their time and anticipated social changes that were to come in the ensuing century. In all five marriages, both husband and wife enjoyed thriving professional lives: a shocking circumstance at a time when wealthy white married women were not supposed to have careers, and career women were not supposed to marry.\n\n\nFolktales of Mayotte, an African Island\n\nAuthor: Lee Haring\nForeword by: Mark Turin\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0315\nThe book uncovers the versatility and literary skills of oral narrators in a small African island. Relying on the researches of three French ethnographers who interviewed storytellers in the 1970s-80s, Lee Haring shows a once-colonised people using verbal art to preserve ancient values in the postcolonial world, when the island of Mayotte was transforming itself from a neglected colony to an overseas department of France.\n\n\nHaving Too Much: Philosophical Essays on Limitarianism\n\nEditor: Ingrid Robeyns\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0338\nHaving Too Much is the first academic volume devoted to limitarianism: the idea that the use of economic or ecosystem resources should not exceed certain limits. This concept has deep roots in economic and political thought. One can find similar statements of such limits in thinkers such as Plato, Aquinas, and Spinoza. But Having Too Much is the first time in contemporary political philosophy that limitarianism is explored at length and in detail.\n\n\nFrom Handwriting to Footprinting: Text and Heritage in the Age of Climate Crisis\n\nAuthor: Anne Baillot\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0355\nIntegrating historical, archival and environmental perspectives, From Handwriting to Footprinting illuminates the impact that digitisation has had on the dissemination and preservation of textual heritage and reflects on what its future may hold. It is invaluable reading for anyone interested in textual history from a linguistic or philological perspective, as well as those working on publishing, archival and infrastructure projects that require the storing and long-term preservation of texts, or who want to know how to develop a more mindful attachment to digitised material."

Whilst twentieth-century scholars spoke about the adaptation of Arabic metrics to Hebrew, he instead approaches these compositions by Andalusi Jews (10th-13th c.) as Arabic metrics written in Hebrew, thus emphasising how Hebrew poetry of the Andalusi Jews can help us to understand the general evolution of Arabic strophic poetry, and its experimental evolution, which is quite unlike classical and strophic Arabic poetry.\n\n\nThe Last Man Who Knew Everything: Thomas Young\n\nAuthor: Andrew Robinson\nForeword by: Martin Rees\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0344\nNo one has given the polymath Thomas Young (1773-1829) the all-round examination he so richly deserves—until now.
