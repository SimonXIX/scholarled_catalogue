John Isbell provides an essential collection that illuminates the impact women writers had on French literature and politics during a time marked by three revolutions, the influx of Romantic art, and rapid technological change.\n\n\nFranklin Ford Collection\n\nEditor: Dominque Tudel\nEditor: Juliette De Maeyer\nBethlehem, PA: mediastudies.press, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.32376/3f8575cb.80aee30a\nThe Franklin Ford Collection, curated and introduced by Dominique Trudel and Juliette De Maeyer, includes letters, leaflets, editorials, and treatises by the American journalist Franklin Ford (1849–1918).\n\n\nOpen Book in Ways of Water\n\nAuthor: Adam Wolfond\nPreface by: Erin Manning\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0454.1.00\n\n\nBreaking Conventions: Five Couples in Search of Marriage-Career Balance at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century\n\nAuthor: Patricia Auspos\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0318\nThis rich history illuminates the lives and partnerships of five married couples – two British, three American – whose unions defied the conventions of their time and anticipated social changes that were to come in the ensuing century. In all five marriages, both husband and wife enjoyed thriving professional lives: a shocking circumstance at a time when wealthy white married women were not supposed to have careers, and career women were not supposed to marry.\n\n\nFolktales of Mayotte, an African Island\n\nAuthor: Lee Haring\nForeword by: Mark Turin\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0315\nThe book uncovers the versatility and literary skills of oral narrators in a small African island. Relying on the researches of three French ethnographers who interviewed storytellers in the 1970s-80s, Lee Haring shows a once-colonised people using verbal art to preserve ancient values in the postcolonial world, when the island of Mayotte was transforming itself from a neglected colony to an overseas department of France.\n\n\nAlgorithmic Authenticity: An Overview\n\nAuthor: Anthony Glyn Burton\nAuthor: Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\nAuthor: Liliana Bounegru\nAuthor: Melody Devries\nAuthor: Amy Harris\nAuthor: hannah holtzclaw\nAuthor: Ioana B.

This book brings together different disciplinary understandings of “authenticity” in order to find alternative ways to approach mis- and disinformation that go beyond contemporary fact-checking and its search for the “authentic” truth. Patterned under the algorithmic flows of digital capitalism, authenticity itself is subject to variation, iteration, and outside influence. Linking cross-disciplinary research on the history and practices of algorithmic authenticity points to new research questions to understand the impact of algorithmic authenticity on social life and its role in contemporary information disorder.\n\n\nFrom Handwriting to Footprinting: Text and Heritage in the Age of Climate Crisis\n\nAuthor: Anne Baillot\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0355\nIntegrating historical, archival and environmental perspectives, From Handwriting to Footprinting illuminates the impact that digitisation has had on the dissemination and preservation of textual heritage and reflects on what its future may hold. It is invaluable reading for anyone interested in textual history from a linguistic or philological perspective, as well as those working on publishing, archival and infrastructure projects that require the storing and long-term preservation of texts, or who want to know how to develop a more mindful attachment to digitised material.\n\n\nHaving Too Much: Philosophical Essays on Limitarianism\n\nEditor: Ingrid Robeyns\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0338\nHaving Too Much is the first academic volume devoted to limitarianism: the idea that the use of economic or ecosystem resources should not exceed certain limits. This concept has deep roots in economic and political thought. One can find similar statements of such limits in thinkers such as Plato, Aquinas, and Spinoza. But Having Too Much is the first time in contemporary political philosophy that limitarianism is explored at length and in detail."

How do post-cinematic media technologies such as AI, VR, and robotics target and re-shape our bodies? Post-Cinematic Bodies grapples with these questions by attending both to mundane devices—such as smartphones, networked exercise machines, and smart watches and other wearables equipped with heartrate sensors—as well as to new media artworks that rework such equipment to reveal to us the ways that our fleshly existences are increasingly up for grabs. Through an equally philosophical and interpretive analysis, the book aims to develop a new aesthetics of embodied experience that is attuned to a new age of predictive technology and metabolic capitalism.\n\n\nDotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies 8: War in the Sudan\n\nEditor: Henriette Hafsaas\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0515.1.00\n\n\nModels in Microeconomic Theory: Expanded Second Edition (He)\n\nAuthor: Martin J.

Part I (Chapters 1-7) presents models of an economic agent, discussing abstract models of preferences, choice, and decision making under uncertainty, before turning to models of the consumer, the producer, and monopoly. Part II (Chapters 8-14) introduces the concept of equilibrium, beginning, unconventionally, with the models of the jungle and an economy with indivisible goods, and continuing with models of an exchange economy, equilibrium with rational expectations, and an economy with asymmetric information. Part III (Chapters 15-16) provides an introduction to game theory, covering strategic and extensive games and the concepts of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium. Part IV (Chapters 17-20) gives a taste of the topics of mechanism design, matching, the axiomatic analysis of economic systems, and social choice.\n\n\nFor Palestine: Essays from the Tom Hurndall Memorial Lecture Group\n\nEditor: Ian Parker\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0345\nThis book is a collection of lectures written by reputable scholars who offer diverse perspectives on the historical, political and cultural struggles in Palestine. Encompassed in the pages are sixteen chapters produced for the Tom Hurndall Memorial Lecture Group. Unlike predecessors of this topic, this book offers a thought-provoking and comprehensive analysis of Palestine, including architectural, cultural, legal, sociological, and psychological questions, providing a larger scope of study that has not yet been done before. Ultimately, this book explores oppression in Palestine and beyond in the Middle East.\n\n\nModels in Microeconomic Theory: Expanded Second Edition (She)\n\nAuthor: Martin J.

Whilst twentieth-century scholars spoke about the adaptation of Arabic metrics to Hebrew, he instead approaches these compositions by Andalusi Jews (10th-13th c.) as Arabic metrics written in Hebrew, thus emphasising how Hebrew poetry of the Andalusi Jews can help us to understand the general evolution of Arabic strophic poetry, and its experimental evolution, which is quite unlike classical and strophic Arabic poetry.\n\n\nThe Last Man Who Knew Everything: Thomas Young\n\nAuthor: Andrew Robinson\nForeword by: Martin Rees\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0344\nNo one has given the polymath Thomas Young (1773-1829) the all-round examination he so richly deserves—until now.

To change this, we should not turn away from it, but look carefully into its transformative power and make operable alternatives such as counter-algorhythms and solidarity-oriented commoning. The aim is a world where profit and property no longer exist, but instead where a cooperative dance – between all the needs posed by our ecosystems, and all the needs of people – becomes practicable. This book is a critical media theory of future-building, modulated by a focus on the potentials of counter-dancing as providing ways to unfold fugitive practices.\n\n\nIntroduction to Systems Biology: Workbook for Flipped-classroom Teaching\n\nAuthor: Thomas Sauter\nAuthor: Marco Albrecht\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0291\nThis book is an introduction to the language of systems biology, which is spoken among many disciplines, from biology to engineering.

Known as “the dean of Jewish sociologists” and “the father of Jewish demography,” Leshchinsky published a series of insightful and moving essays in Yiddish on Polish Jewry between 1927 and 1937. Despite heightened interest in interwar Jewish communities in Poland in recent years, these essays (like most of Leshchinsky’s works) have never been translated into English. The Last Years of Polish Jewry helps to rectify this situation by translating some of Leshchinsky’s key essays.\n\n\nSusan Isaacs: A Life Freeing the Minds of Children\n\nAuthor: Philip Graham\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0297\nThis revised and expanded edition of Susan Isaacs: A Life Freeing the Minds of Children by Philip Graham, provides a comprehensive biography of a highly influential educationist and psychoanalyst.

Focusing on cases of dissonance between the tradition’s written (consonantal) and reading (vocalic) components, the study shows that the Tiberian spelling and pronunciation traditions, though related, interdependent, and largely in harmony, at numerous points reflect distinct oral realisations of the biblical text."

While Covid-19 demonstrated some of the benefits of online learning, the widespread, often uncritical adoption of online tools driven by necessity has left many with an experience of ‘emergency online learning’. This book aims to assist in the design of technology-enhanced capacity development by sharing evidence of practices that are principled rather than rushed; inclusive rather than creating new digital divides.\nPart 1 sets out the main thinking that informs our overall approach and the frameworks that guide our practice. Part 2 explores a series of assumptions about technology-enhanced learning (TEL) that are common in the literature and against which we tested our data. It brings new evidence to bear on how TEL can be used more effectively as part of learning and capacity strengthening. Part 3 is designed as a practical guide to walk practitioners through the steps to create relevant, inclusive and sustainable digital learning interventions. Part 4 offers a collection of 16 case studies that illustrate how we have put the principles into practice. We have worked to evidence how technology can be leveraged effectively to enhance or strengthen capacities of individuals, teams or systems. We make clear that there are no magic bullets, that online approaches are not simply quicker or cheaper substitutes, and that solutions need to be selected carefully, designed well, and significant time invested if it is to work well.\nWe hope Digital Technology in Capacity Development will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in a range of institutions, whether they are directly responsible for designing, delivering or evaluating new initiatives or whether they are advising or funding those who do.\n\n\nWho Counts? Ghanaian Academic Publishing and Global Science\n\nAuthor: David Mills\nAuthor: Patricia Kingori\nAuthor: Abigail Branford\nAuthor: Samuel T. Chatio\nAuthor: Natasha Robinson\nAuthor: Paulina Tindana\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502647\nSince the 1990s, global academic publishing has been transformed by digitisation, consolidation and the rise of the internet. The data produced by commercially owned citation indexes increasingly defines legitimate academic knowledge. Publication in prestigious ‘high impact’ journals can be traded for academic promotion, tenure and job-security. African researchers and publishers labour in the shadows of a global knowledge system dominated by ‘Northern’ journals and by global publishing conglomerates. This book goes beyond the numbers. It tells the story of how the Ghanaian academy is being transformed by this bibliometric economy. It offers a rich account of the voices and perspectives of Ghanaian academics and African journal publishers. How, where and when are Ghana’s researchers disseminating their work, and what do these experiences reveal about an unequal global science system? Is there pressure to publish in ‘reputable’ international journals, what role do supervisors, collaborators and mentors play, and how do academics manage in conditions of scarcity? Putting the insights of more than 40 Ghanaian academics into dialogue with journal editors and publishers from across the continent, the book highlights creative responses, along with the emergence of new regional research ecosystems. This is an important Africa-centred analysis of Anglophone academic publishing on the continent and its relationship to global science.\n\n\nNotes on Trumpspace: Politics, Aesthetics, and the Fantasy of Home\n\nAuthor: David Markus\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0366.1.00\n\n\nCreativity: Process and Personality\n\nAuthor: Larry Gross\nBethlehem, PA: mediastudies.press, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.32376/3f8575cb.60b97b6f\nCreativity: Process and Personality, a 1964 thesis published for the first time, features interviews on creativity with prominent psychologists, including B.

Reflections on Modernity and the Moving Image\n\nEditor: Cynthia Kros\nEditor: Reece Auguiste\nEditor: Pervaiz Khan\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502678\nThis book takes readers on a series of stimulating intellectual journeys from the late nineteenth century to the contemporary era to explore notions of modernity in the production and reception of the African moving image and of African archival practices. Ideas are presented from multiple historical and contemporary perspectives, while inviting new voices to participate in discussions about the future of the African moving image.\nReframing Africa?makes a plea for the recognition, preservation and repatriation of the African moving image archive, advancing ideas about how it speaks to contemporary Africans, possessed of the power to elucidate their lived experiences and to reorientate perceptions of the past, present and future. On the basis of this wide-ranging appreciation of the archive, the book charts a way forward for African-inflected film studies as well as other programmes in the humanities and social sciences.\nReframing Africa? will appeal to scholars, academics and practitioners across the continent and beyond.\n\n\nChance Encounters: A Bioethics for a Damaged Planet\n\nAuthor: Kristien Hens\nIllustrator: Christina Stadlbauer\nIllustrator: Bart H.M. Vandeput\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0320\nIn this rigorous and necessary book, Kristien Hens brings together bioethics and the philosophy of biology to argue that it is ethically necessary for scientific research to include a place for the philosopher. As well as ethical, their role is conceptual: they can improve the quality and coherence of scientific research by ensuring that particular concepts are used consistently and thoughtfully across interdisciplinary projects. Hens argues that chance and uncertainty play a central part in bioethics, but that these qualities can be in tension with the attempt to establish a given theory as scientific knowledge: in describing organisms and practices, in a sense we create the world. Hens contends that this is necessarily an ethical activity.\n\n\nLandscapes of Investigation: Contributions to Critical Mathematics Education\n\nEditor: Miriam Godoy Penteado\nEditor: Ole Skovsmose\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0316\nCreating landscapes of investigation is a primary concern of critical mathematics education. It enables us to organise educational processes so that students and teachers are able to get involved in explorations guided by dialogical interactions. It attempts to address explicit or implicit forms of social injustice by means of mathematics, and also to promote a critical conception of mathematics, challenging the assumption that the subject represents objectivity and neutrality. Landscapes of Investigation provides many illustrations of how this can be done in primary, secondary, and university education. It also illustrates how exploring landscapes of investigation can contribute to mathematics teacher education programmes.\n\n\nCommunication Conduct in an Island Community\n\nAuthor: Erving Goffman\nIntroduction by: Yves Winkin\nBethlehem, PA: mediastudies.press, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.32376/3f8575cb.baaa50af\nErving Goffman’s 1953 dissertation, published here for the first time on the hundredth anniversary of his birth.\n\n\nGreening Europe: 2022 European Public Investment Outlook\n\nEditor: Floriana Cerniglia\nEditor: Francesco Saraceno\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0328\nThe third installment of the ‘European Public Investment Outlook’ series is an important and timely publication that draws together recent analyses to recommend significant increases in public investment in green ventures. Compelling data from key economists affiliated with international organizations like the International Monetary Fund, European Investment Bank and the European Commission, as well as academic departments and policy institutes are a clarion call for green investment to boost the economy and put the planet on a sustainable path.\n\n\nTransforming Conservation: A Practical Guide to Evidence and Decision Making\n\nEditor: William J.

In this book an international team of experts provide solutions.\n\n\nMusic in Evolution and Evolution in Music\n\nAuthor: Steven Jan\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0301\nMusic in Evolution and Evolution in Music by Steven Jan is a comprehensive account of the relationships between evolutionary theory and music. Examining the ‘evolutionary algorithm’ that drives biological and musical-cultural evolution, the book provides a distinctive commentary on how musicality and music can shed light on our understanding of Darwin’s famous theory – and vice-versa.\n\n\nWilliam Rimmer: Champion of Imagination in American Art\n\nAuthor: Dorinda Evans\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0304\nWilliam Rimmer (1816–1879) is arguably the first modernist American sculptor, although his inventive originality has not been fully acknowledged. Rimmer cultivated an art of ideas and personal expression whilst supporting himself as a physician and, later, as a teacher of art anatomy at the Cooper Union School of Design for Women in New York.\n\n\nStatic Palace\n\nAuthor: Leora Fridman\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0411.1.00"

Marcel Cobussen intertwines sonic studies with philosophy, sound art, sociology and more to create an impressively lucid and innovative guide to sonic materialism, calling for a re-sensitization to our acoustic environment and arguing that everyday sounds have (micro)political, social, and ethical impact to which we should attend.\n\n\nThe Bible in the Bowls: A Catalogue of Biblical Quotations in Published Jewish Babylonian Aramaic Magic Bowls\n\nAuthor: Daniel James Waller\nContributions by: Dorota Molin\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0305\nThe Bible in the Bowls represents a complete catalogue of Hebrew Bible quotations found in the published corpus of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic magic bowls. As our only direct epigraphic witnesses to the Hebrew Bible from late antique Babylonia, the bowls are uniquely placed to contribute to research on the (oral) transmission of the biblical text in late antiquity; the pre-Masoretic Babylonian vocalisation tradition; the formation of the liturgy and the early development of the Jewish prayer book; the social locations of biblical knowledge in late antique Babylonia and socio-religious typologies of the bowls; and the dynamics of scriptural citation in ancient Jewish magic.\n\n\nMy Phone Lies to Me: Fake News Poetry Workshops As Radical Digital Media Literacy Given the Fact of Fake News\n\nEditor: Alexandra Juhasz\nForeword by: Tara McPherson\nAfterword by: Margaret Rhee\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0394.1.00\n\n\nWomen and Migration(s) II\n\nEditor: Cheryl Finley\nEditor: Ellyn Toscano\nEditor: Deborah Willis\nEditor: Kalia Brooks\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0296\nWomen and Migration(s) II draws together contributions from scholars and artists showcasing the breadth of intersectional experiences of migration, from diaspora to internal displacement. Building on conversations initiated in Women and Migration: Responses in Art and History, this edited volume features a range of written styles, from memoir to artists’ statements to journalistic and critical essays. The collection shows how women’s experiences of migration have been articulated through art, film, poetry and even food.\n\n\nFascism, Vulnerability, and the Escape from Freedom: Readings to Repair Democracy\n\nAuthor: C.

By turning to infrastructures, their logic and functioning, collapse and malfunction, the volume reveals their potential as fragile material witnesses to and of disasters. As climate change is unequally distributed across continuous dynamics and events, time scales and spatial registers, infrastructures can be understood as proxies or seismographs mediating different spatio-temporal layers that make these dynamics tangible. Disaster is made operational by negotiating what is defined as such, and under which geopolitical conditions. What connects melting glaciers and the knowledge from ice cores to the mapping of the ocean floor and the extraction of resources in the deep-sea? How can infrastructures be thought in time and “critical proximity”, and how do they bear witness to colonial pasts and presents? The volume proposes an analytical perspective on infrastructures as multi-layered witnesses to climate change, bringing together scientific and artistic approaches, students and scholars from different disciplines.\n\n\n‘Fragile States’ in an Unequal World: The Role of the g7+ in International Diplomacy and Development Cooperation\n\nAuthor: Isabel Rocha de Siqueira\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0311\nThis is a book about people. ‘Fragile States’ in an Unequal World: The Role of the g7+ in International Diplomacy and Development Cooperation introduces the members of the g7+, a group formed by 20 conflict-affected states: why they came to believe in politics and policy; how they feel about their work, their family and their communities; and what they want to leave behind for the next generations. It is the story of their personal and collective values, their mistakes, and the challenges they faced, and it will resonate with anyone who has tried to organize and work with a group of very different people.\n\n\nDiachronic Variation in the Omani Arabic Vernacular of the Al-ʿAwābī District: From Carl Reinhardt (1894) to the Present Day\n\nAuthor: Roberta Morano\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0298\nIn this monograph, Roberta Morano re-examines one of the foundational works of the Omani Arabic dialectology field, Carl Reinhardt’s Ein arabischer Dialekt gesprochen in ’Oman und Zanzibar (1894). This German-authored work was prolific in shaping our knowledge of Omani Arabic during the twentieth century, until the 1980s when more recent linguistic studies on the Arabic varieties spoken in Oman began to appear.\n\n\nSomething More Splendid Than Two\n\nAuthor: josé rivers alfaro\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0412.1.00\n\n\nLife, Re-Scaled: The Biological Imagination in Twenty-First-Century Literature and Performance\n\nEditor: Liliane Campos\nEditor: Pierre-Louis Patoine\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0303\nThis edited volume explores new engagements with the life sciences in contemporary fiction, poetry, comics and performance. The gathered case studies investigate how recent creative work reframes the human within microscopic or macroscopic scales, from cellular biology to systems ecology, and engages with the ethical, philosophical, and political issues raised by the twenty-first century’s shifting views of life. The collection thus examines literature and performance as spaces that shape our contemporary biological imagination.\n\n\nThe Official Indonesian Qurʾān Translation: The History and Politics of Al-Qur’an dan Terjemahnya\n\nAuthor: Fadhli Lukman\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0289\nThis book studies the political and institutional project of Al-Qur’an dan Terjemahnya, the official translation of the Qurʾān into Indonesian by the Indonesian government. It investigates how the translation was produced and presented, and how it is read, as well as considering the implications of the state’s involvement in such a work."

Films, photographs, and documents have continued to emerge from the camp and become the focus of fierce legal and political battles, as well as intense moral anguish. This book looks at how the US Department of Defense has struggled, and often failed, to control the public perception of these media objects through complex, layered framing devices. It traces how small ruptures in the Department’s framings have provided openings for critical interventions from various fields – ranging from journalism and human rights law to the arts. Guantánamo Frames thus lays the groundwork for a critical reappraisal of the entanglement of media, violence, and the security state in a broader sense.\n\n\nNonconscious: On the Affective Synching of Mind and Machine\n\nAuthor: Marie-Luise Angerer\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/2041\nGrowing numbers of nonhuman companions are creating affective synching between human and nonhuman agency. Unlike the unconscious of psychoanalysis, this book argues, the resulting nonconscious is no longer coupled to a subject grounded in language, instead acting as an affective link between technical, mental, and physical processes.\n\n\nThe Diaries of Anthony Hewitson, Provincial Journalist, Volume 1: 1865–1887\n\nEditor: Andrew Hobbs\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0262\nAnthony Hewitson was a typical Victorian journalist, working in one of the largest sectors of the periodical press, provincial newspapers. His diaries, written between 1862 and 1912, lift the veil of anonymity hiding the people, processes and networks involved in the creation of Victorian newspapers. Andrew Hobbs’s introduction and footnotes provide background and analysis of these valuable documents. This full scholarly edition offers a wealth of new information about reporting, freelancing, sub-editing, newspaper ownership and publishing, and illuminates aspects of Victorian periodicals and culture extending far beyond provincial newspapers.\n\n\nThe Dark Posthuman: Dehumanization, Technology, and the Atlantic World\n\nAuthor: Stephanie Polsky\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0381.1.00\n\n\nSpeaking for the Social: A Catalog of Methods\n\nEditor: Gemma John\nEditor: Hannah Knox\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0378.1.00\n\n\nA Credible Utopia: Essays on Selected Films of Werner Schroeter\n\nAuthor: Peter Valente\nEarth, Milky Way: punctum books, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.53288/0391.1.00\n\n\nAn Outline of Romanticism in the West\n\nAuthor: John Claiborne Isbell\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0302\nNavigating the landscape of Romantic literature and art across Europe and the Americas, An Outline of Romanticism in the West invites readers to embark upon a literary journey.

While Covid-19 demonstrated some of the benefits of online learning, the widespread, often uncritical adoption of online tools driven by necessity has left many with an experience of ‘emergency online learning’. This book aims to assist in the design of technology-enhanced capacity development by sharing evidence of practices that are principled rather than rushed; inclusive rather than creating new digital divides.\nPart 1 sets out the main thinking that informs our overall approach and the frameworks that guide our practice. Part 2 explores a series of assumptions about technology-enhanced learning (TEL) that are common in the literature and against which we tested our data. It brings new evidence to bear on how TEL can be used more effectively as part of learning and capacity strengthening. Part 3 is designed as a practical guide to walk practitioners through the steps to create relevant, inclusive and sustainable digital learning interventions. Part 4 offers a collection of 16 case studies that illustrate how we have put the principles into practice. We have worked to evidence how technology can be leveraged effectively to enhance or strengthen capacities of individuals, teams or systems. We make clear that there are no magic bullets, that online approaches are not simply quicker or cheaper substitutes, and that solutions need to be selected carefully, designed well, and significant time invested if it is to work well.\nWe hope Digital Technology in Capacity Development will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in a range of institutions, whether they are directly responsible for designing, delivering or evaluating new initiatives or whether they are advising or funding those who do.\n\n\nWho Counts? Ghanaian Academic Publishing and Global Science\n\nAuthor: Paulina Tindana\nAuthor: David Mills\nAuthor: Patricia Kingori\nAuthor: Abigail Branford\nAuthor: Natasha Robinson\nAuthor: Samuel T. Chatio\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502647\nSince the 1990s, global academic publishing has been transformed by digitisation, consolidation and the rise of the internet. The data produced by commercially owned citation indexes increasingly defines legitimate academic knowledge. Publication in prestigious ‘high impact’ journals can be traded for academic promotion, tenure and job-security. African researchers and publishers labour in the shadows of a global knowledge system dominated by ‘Northern’ journals and by global publishing conglomerates. This book goes beyond the numbers. It tells the story of how the Ghanaian academy is being transformed by this bibliometric economy. It offers a rich account of the voices and perspectives of Ghanaian academics and African journal publishers. How, where and when are Ghana’s researchers disseminating their work, and what do these experiences reveal about an unequal global science system? Is there pressure to publish in ‘reputable’ international journals, what role do supervisors, collaborators and mentors play, and how do academics manage in conditions of scarcity? Putting the insights of more than 40 Ghanaian academics into dialogue with journal editors and publishers from across the continent, the book highlights creative responses, along with the emergence of new regional research ecosystems. This is an important Africa-centred analysis of Anglophone academic publishing on the continent and its relationship to global science."

Reflections on Modernity and the Moving Image\n\nEditor: Reece Auguiste\nEditor: Cynthia Kros\nEditor: Pervaiz Khan\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502678\nThis book takes readers on a series of stimulating intellectual journeys from the late nineteenth century to the contemporary era to explore notions of modernity in the production and reception of the African moving image and of African archival practices. Ideas are presented from multiple historical and contemporary perspectives, while inviting new voices to participate in discussions about the future of the African moving image.\nReframing Africa?makes a plea for the recognition, preservation and repatriation of the African moving image archive, advancing ideas about how it speaks to contemporary Africans, possessed of the power to elucidate their lived experiences and to reorientate perceptions of the past, present and future. On the basis of this wide-ranging appreciation of the archive, the book charts a way forward for African-inflected film studies as well as other programmes in the humanities and social sciences.\nReframing Africa? will appeal to scholars, academics and practitioners across the continent and beyond."

It centres on and explores a number of themes, which include her challenges not only as a South African citizen, and within her faith community, but as an academic citizen at a historically white university. The book is her story, an autoethnography, her reparation.\nBy embarking on an auto-ethnography, she not only tries to change the way her story has been told by others, transforms her ‘sense of what it means to live’ (Bhabha, 1994). She is driven by a postcolonial appeal, which insists that if she seeks to imprint her own way of life into the discourses which pervade the world around her, then she can no longer allow herself to be spoken on behalf of or to be subjugated into the hegemonies of others.\nThe main argument of Out of Place is that Muslim, ‘coloured’ women are subjected to layers of scrutiny and prejudices, which have yet to be confronted. What we know about Muslim ‘coloured’ women has been shaped by preconceived notions of ‘otherness’, and attached to a meta-narrative of ‘oppression and backwardness’. By centring and using her lived experiences, the author takes readers on a journey of what it is like to be seen in terms of race, gender and religion – not only within the public sphere of her professional identities, but within the private sphere of her faith community.\n\n\nLow-Income Students, Human Development and Higher Education in South Africa: Opportunities, obstacles and outcomes\n\nAuthor: Mikateko Mathebula\nAuthor: Melanie Walker\nAuthor: Patience Mukwambo\nAuthor: Monica McLean\nCape Town: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502395\n\n\nPositioning Diversity in Kenyan Schools: Teaching in the Face of Inequality and Discrimination\n\nAuthor: Malve von Möllendorff\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502333\nEducation is considered key for societies to achieve greater social cohesion and equality. Yet, schools, as the main providers of formal education, have increasingly come into question concerning their role in manifesting and perpetuating social categorisations, inequalities and discrimination instead of decreasing existing fragmentations and challenging power relations and hierarchies.\nAs a diverse society, Kenya is faced with power struggles and rivalries between different groups – for instance, along ethnic lines, often constructed deep in colonial history. This affects teaching and learning in school and the result is that Kenya is faced with vast disparities in terms of educational access and success – rendering some social groups marginalised and others favoured.\nPositioning Diversity at Kenyan Schools explores the ways in which teachers in Kenyan primary and secondary schools experience and deal with social categorisations and diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, wealth, culture, religion, etc. in their professional practice and in the current education system. Using critical pedagogy and diversity theory as a lens for positioning diversity in Kenyan schools, the questions that this book sets out to answer are: In what ways do the teachers’ and schools’ practices lead to transformation in terms of more social equality and less discrimination? In what ways do the practices manifest existing group categorisations, hierarchies and discrimination? How can schools and teaching practices in postcolonial Kenya become more inclusive and foster social cohesion and equality?"

Govender\nEditor: Tabisa Mayisela\nEditor: Cheryl Ann Hodgkinson-Williams\nSouth Africa: African Minds, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.47622/9781928502425\nThis volume investigates the uptake of ‘open learning’ in South African Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges and higher education institutions. Comprised of 16 studies focused on activities at a range of colleges and universities across the country, these chapters aim to promote a better understanding of open learning practices across the Post-School Education and Training (PSET) sector, including issues such as: recognition of prior learning, access for students with disabilities, work integrated learning, professional development, novel student funding mechanisms, leadership for open educational practices, institutional culture, student support, blended and online learning, flexible learning, online assessment, open educational resource development models and funding, and micro-credentials.\nThis collection of peer-reviewed chapters contributes to understanding the ways in which South African PSET institutions and educators are interpreting ‘open learning’ as a means of advancing social justice. It includes a historical and contemporary understanding of the economic, cultural and political obstacles facing PSET, drawing on Nancy Fraser’s theory of social justice as ‘participatory parity’ to better understand the ways in which ‘open learning’ may address systemic social injustices in order to allow South African students and educators to thrive.\nThis volume emerges from research conducted by the Cases on Open Learning (COOL) project, an initiative by the Department of Higher Education and Training in partnership with the Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa."

The book turns the well-known sites of contemporary Euro-American democracy – elections, bureaucracies, public debates and citizen participation – into fluctuating democratic situations where supposedly untouchable democratic ideals are contested and warped in practice. The empirical cases demonstrate that democracy cannot be reduced to theoretical schemes of conflict, institutions or deliberation. Instead, they offer an urgently needed renewal of our understanding of democratic politics at a time when conventional ideas increasingly fail to capture current events such as Brexit, Trump and Covid19."

Current debates around encryption have fundamental implications for our individual liberties and collective presence on the Internet. Encryption of communications at scale and in increasingly usable ways has become a matter of public concern, especially since Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations. A new cryptographic imaginary is taking hold, which sees encryption as a necessary precondition for the formation of networked publics. At the same time, there have been major evolutions and accelerations in the field of secure communications, prompted in part by the cryptography community’s renewed efforts to create next-generation secure messaging protocols and applications. The book explores developers’ actions and their interactions with other stakeholders, for instance users, security trainers, standardising bodies, and funding organizations. It also examines their interactions with the technical artifacts they develop, in which a core common objective is to create tools that “conceal for freedom” even as how this objective is met differs according to technical architectures, the user publics being targeted and the tools’ underlying values and business models."

Suggestions to deliberately alter, to engineer, the Earth’s climate have gained political currency in recent years not as a positive vision of techno-scientific innovation, but as a daunting measure of last resort. The controversial status of various so-called climate engineering proposals raises a simple, yet pressing question: How has it has come to this? And, more specifically, how did such contested measures earn their place on policy agendas, despite enormous scientific complexities and fierce political contestation?"

But what does it mean to be with microbes? With Microbes sets microbes and the multiple ways they exist around, in and on humans at center stage. In this book, 24 social scientists and artists attune to microbes and describe their complicated relationships with humans and other beings. The book shows the multiplicity of these relationships and their dynamism, through detailed ethnographies of the relationships between humans, animals, plants, and microbes. Ethnographic explorations with fermented foods, waste, faecal matter, immunity, antimicrobial resistance, phages, as well as indigenous and scientific understandings of microbes challenge ideas of them being simple entities: not just pathogenic foes, old friends or good fermentation minions, but so much more. By describing these complex, dynamic, and ever-changing entanglements between humans and microbes, the chapters raise crucial points about how microbes are ‘known’ and how social scientists can study microbes with ethnographic methods, more often than not in the absence of microscopes, models, and computations. Following these various entanglements, the book tells how these relations transform both humans and microbes in the process."

Contributions in this volume examine how sensing devices gain political and epistemic relevance in various forms of in/security, from border control, regulation, and epidemiological tracking, to aerial surveillance and hacking. Instead of focusing on specific sensory devices and their consequences, this volume explores the complex and sometimes invisible political, cultural and ethical processes of infrastructuring in/security."

Rather than uncovering or building up one story about the Danish-Ghanaian past, the work insists on providing ‘inconclusive’ analyses, collaboratively generated in the course of the project work and in the process of writing ethnographically about it. The ambition is to nurture fieldwork as an opportunity for creating a common ground, on which to think about what heritage and ethnography could be. Common ground, then, is not only an ideal of the joint heritage project, but an expression of an anthropological ambition. In consequence, the book is an account of a particular ethnographic research project – the ‘methods story’ being about how post-colonial relations might be noticed and supported and about how empirical research is done as relations between what is going on in the field and the way that the ethnographer chooses to tell the story of the field in the text.\n\n\nInventing the Social\n\nEditor: Noortje Marres\nEditor: Michael Guggenheim\nEditor: Alex Wilkie\nManchester, UK: Mattering Press, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.28938/9780995527768\nInventing the Social, edited by Noortje Marres, Michael Guggenheim and Alex Wilkie, showcases recent efforts to develop new ways of knowing society that combine social research with creative practice. With contributions from leading figures in sociology, architecture, geography, design, anthropology, and digital media, the book provides practical and conceptual pointers on how to move beyond the customary distinctions between knowledge and art, and on how to connect the doing, researching and making of social life in potentially new ways.\nPresenting concrete projects with a creative approach to researching social life as well as reflections on the wider contexts from which these projects emerge, this collection shows how collaboration across social science, digital media and the arts opens up timely alternatives to narrow, instrumentalist proposals that seek to engineer behaviour and to design community from scratch. To invent the social is to recognise that social life is always already creative in itself and to take this as a starting point for developing different ways of combining representation and intervention in social life."

The contributions to this volume develop “ethnographic casing” as a technique of attending to heterogeneities in systems of thought. Medical cases. Legal cases. Briefcases. Detective cases. Some cases featured are violent, others compassionate; some set stereotypes in motion, others break them down. Connected more by difference than similarity, the “cases” in this volume make a case for the virtue of relational science. This is a science that is not beholden to the masters’ narratives, but which embraces the double-work of caring for detail, while caring for the practices through which one learns to care. In 26 gripping and provocative installations, the volume showcases research from numerous influential feminist and decolonial scholars. Where anthropology has long sought to identify patterns in culture, this volume makes space for inquiry focused on particularities and advocates for an intellectual politics where that which doesn’t fit is still allowed to matter."

It is also about the practical acts of doing comparison. Comparison is not something that exists in the world, but a particular kind of activity.\nAgents of various kinds compare by placing things next to one another, by using software programs and other tools, and by simply looking in certain ways. Comparing like this is an everyday practice. But in the social sciences, comparing often becomes more burdensome, more complex, and more questions are asked of it.\nHow, then, do social scientists compare? What role do funders, their tools, and databases play in social scientific comparisons? Which sorts of objects do they choose to compare and how do they decide which comparisons are meaningful? Doing comparison in the social sciences, it emerges, is a practice weighed down by a history in which comparison was seen as problematic. As it plays out in the present, this history encounters a range of other agents also involved in doing comparison who may challenge the comparisons of social scientists themselves."

By turning to infrastructures, their logic and functioning, collapse and malfunction, the volume reveals their potential as fragile material witnesses to and of disasters. As climate change is unequally distributed across continuous dynamics and events, time scales and spatial registers, infrastructures can be understood as proxies or seismographs mediating different spatio-temporal layers that make these dynamics tangible. Disaster is made operational by negotiating what is defined as such, and under which geopolitical conditions. What connects melting glaciers and the knowledge from ice cores to the mapping of the ocean floor and the extraction of resources in the deep-sea? How can infrastructures be thought in time and “critical proximity”, and how do they bear witness to colonial pasts and presents? The volume proposes an analytical perspective on infrastructures as multi-layered witnesses to climate change, bringing together scientific and artistic approaches, students and scholars from different disciplines."

Films, photographs, and documents have continued to emerge from the camp and become the focus of fierce legal and political battles, as well as intense moral anguish. This book looks at how the US Department of Defense has struggled, and often failed, to control the public perception of these media objects through complex, layered framing devices. It traces how small ruptures in the Department’s framings have provided openings for critical interventions from various fields – ranging from journalism and human rights law to the arts. Guantánamo Frames thus lays the groundwork for a critical reappraisal of the entanglement of media, violence, and the security state in a broader sense.\n\n\nNonconscious: On the Affective Synching of Mind and Machine\n\nAuthor: Marie-Luise Angerer\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/2041\nGrowing numbers of nonhuman companions are creating affective synching between human and nonhuman agency. Unlike the unconscious of psychoanalysis, this book argues, the resulting nonconscious is no longer coupled to a subject grounded in language, instead acting as an affective link between technical, mental, and physical processes."

Dotzler\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1983\nMitte der 1960er Jahre hat Michel Foucault die Methode der „Diskursanalyse“ in die Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften eingeführt. Besonders in der Archäologie des Wissens hat er dafür plädiert, die Geschichte des Wissens und der Wissenschaften zum Gegenstand diskursanalytischer Untersuchungen zu machen. Über ein halbes Jahrhundert später ist im Bereich der Informatik ein zunehmendes Interesse an der Diskursanalyse zu verzeichnen. In der Regel spielt Foucault dabei aber keine Rolle. Fern von jeder Archäologie setzen auch die Digital Humanities vermehrt auf die Analyse von historischen und gegenwärtigen Diskursen. Angesichts dieser Konjunkturen ist es an der Zeit, die Archäologie des Wissens neu zu lesen. Denn schon 1968 behauptete der französische Historiker Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie „Der zukünftige Historiker wird Programmierer sein, oder er wird nicht sein.“ Ein Jahr später gibt Foucault mit seinem Buch auf eben diese Herausforderung eine ebenso informierte wie nuancierte Antwort. Diese Antwort ist in ihrer Aktualität und Relevanz erst noch zu entdecken."

But what is generally ignored is its structural conservatism, its identitarian logic in which everything should remain in its place and nothing should mix, and its proximity to Nazi ideology and politics. By turning the spotlight on these neglected aspects, Uexküll’s Surroundings opens up a new perspective on Uexküll’s Umwelt theory."

Offering a wide-ranging discussion of contemporary digital art practices, philosophical and technical considerations of AI, posthumanist thought, and emerging issues of intellectual property and the commons, this book is firmly positioned against the anthropomorphic spectacle of “creative AI.” It proposes instead the concept of the posthumanist agential assemblage, and invites readers to consider what new types of creative practice, what reconfigurations of the author function, and what critical interventions become possible when AI art provokes tactical entanglements between aesthetics, law, and capital.\n\n\nUndoing Networks\n\nAuthor: Tero Karppi\nAuthor: Clara Wieghorst\nAuthor: Urs Stäheli\nAuthor: Lea P.

First, technological innovations such as affective computing, mood tracking, sentiment analysis, and social robotics all share a focus on the recognition and modulation of human affectivity. Affect gets measured, calculated, controlled. Secondly, recent developments in politics, social media usage, and right-wing journalism have contributed to a conspicuous rise of hate speech, cybermobbing, public shaming, “felt truths,” and resentful populisms. In a very specific way, politics as well as power have become affective.\nAffect gets mobilized, fomented, unleashed.

For them, perhaps for us, it is a 39-minute and 13-second farewell. A long goodbye. My angle is different. By situating the Bowie/Renck collaboration on “Lazarus” in the context of a meditation on the question once posed by Georg Stanitzek, “Was ist Kommunikation?” I consider the CD and the video as experiments in re-configuration. More specifically, by thinking about the distinctly cinematic iteration of the question of communication (citing here Captain’s “what we have here is … failure to communicate” from Cool Hand Luke) I propose that mediated communication embodies the Ich/Es modality of dialogue disparaged by Martin Buber. What this invites us to consider is whether “Lazarus” in particular isn’t the generation of an audiovisual tombeau from which or out of which communication strains are to be heard. Is it “saying” farewell? Is it “saying” anything? By drawing on Jacques Derrida’s appropriation of the crypt in the work of Abraham and Torok, I propose that “Lazarus” manages (and the feat is neither small nor insignificant) to communicate nothing. In effect, “Lazarus” is the very sound, not of a failure to communicate, but of a “speaking” emptied of what protects it from mediation. Here, Bowie’s gnomic persona assumes a political valence not typically ascribed to it.\n\n\nBeyond the Flow: Scholarly Publications During and After the Digital\n\nAuthor: Niels-Oliver Walkowski\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1600\nIn the wake of the so-called digital revolution numerous attempts have been made to rethink and redesign what scholarly publications can or should be. Beyond the Flow examines the technologies as well as narratives driving this unfolding transformation. By unpacking the confusion, heterogeneity and uncertainty that is surrounding scholarly publishing today the book asks for how a sustainable post-digital publishing ecology can be imagined."

Calling for the necessity to reimagine the potentials of archives in practice, the three contributions ask: Can archives fulfill their paradoxical potential as utopian sites in which the analog and the digital, the past and future, and remembrance and forgetting commingle?"

Anthropology offers media archaeologies of markets, and the sociology of markets and finance unravels how contemporary financial markets have witnessed a media technological arms race. Building on such work, this volume brings together key thinkers of economic studies with German media theory, describes the central role of the media specificity of markets in new detail and inflects them in three distinct ways. Nik-Khah and Mirowski show how the denigration of human cognition and the concomitant faith in computation prevalent in contemporary market-design practices rely on neoliberal conceptions of information in markets. Schröter confronts the asymmetries and abstractions that characterize money as a medium and explores the absence of money in media. Beverungen situates these inflections and gathers further elements for a politically and historically attuned media theory of markets concerned with contemporary phenomena such as high-frequency trading and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nCommunication\n\nAuthor: Paula Bialski\nAuthor: Finn Brunton\nAuthor: Mercedes Bunz\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1464\nContemporary communication puts us not only in conversation with one another but also with our machinery. Machine communication—to communicate not just via but also with machines—is therefore the focus of this volume. Diving into digital communications history, Finn Brunton brings to the fore the alienness of computational communication by looking at network timekeeping, automated trolling, and early attempts at communication with extraterrestrial life. Picking up this fascination with inhuman communication, Mercedes Bunz then performs a close reading of interaction design and interfaces to show how technology addresses humans (as very young children). Finally, Paula Bialski shares her findings from a field study of software development, analyzing the communicative forms that occur when code is written by separate people. Today, communication unfolds merely between two or more conscious entities but often includes an invisible third party. Inspired by this drastic shift, this volume uncovers new meanings of what it means “to communicate.”\n\n\nMachine\n\nAuthor: Thomas Patrick Pringle\nAuthor: Gertrud Koch\nAuthor: Bernard Stiegler\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1488\nIn contrast with media constructed as vast, ontologically homogeneous, non-localized systems, formats show material networks of interoperability and exclusions, inscribed in local specificities, and involving precise conditions for the circulation of images and sounds. Formats, institutionalized as standards, frame the “technical networks” defined by Gilbert Simondon, that unfold technical objects into economically and politically structured webs that cover the world. Media are always formatted and, as such, do not flow: they are displaced."

And yet this power seems incomprehensible: understood as code, it becomes apolitical; understood as a totality, it becomes overwhelming. This book takes an alternate approach, using it to unravel the operations of Uber and Palantir, Airbnb and Amazon Alexa. Moving off the whiteboard and into the world, the algorithmic must negotiate with frictions—the ‘merely’ technical routines of distributing data and running tasks coming together into broader social forces that shape subjectivities, steer bodies, and calibrate relationships. Driven by the imperatives of capital, the algorithmic exhausts subjects and spaces, a double move seeking to both exhaustively apprehend them and exhaust away their productivities. But these on-the-ground encounters also reveal that force is never guaranteed. The irreducibility of the world renders logic inadequate and control gives way to contingency.\n\n\nPattern Discrimination\n\nAuthor: Hito Steyerl\nAuthor: Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\nAuthor: Clemens Apprich\nAuthor: Florian Cramer\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1457\nAlgorithmic identity politics reinstate old forms of social segregation—in a digital world, identity politics is pattern discrimination.

Dabei gewinnt die in den 1970er Jahren von James Lovelock gemeinsam mit Lynn Margulis entwickelte Gaia-Theorie heute neue Erklärungskraft. Wenn Gaia bei Bruno Latour sogar zum allgemeinen Modell der Welterklärung im 21. Jahrhundert wird, gilt es, nach der Plausibilität zu fragen, die die Rede von Gaia aktuell entwickelt. Die vier Beiträge des Bandes geben hierauf eine Antwort, indem sie die metaphorologischen und begriffshistorischen Linien der Gaia-Theorie nachzeichnen und ihren Bezug auf zeitgenössische Computersimulationen in den Blick nehmen. So wird der gegenwärtige Ort des Wiederauflebens Gaias deutlich – und damit die Verschränkung von kybernetischen und organizistischen Ökologien mit der Annahme einer Programmierbarkeit von Umgebungen.\n\n\nUnterwachen und Schlafen: Anthropophile Medien nach dem Interface\n\nAuthor: Suzana Alpsancar\nAuthor: Kevin Liggieri\nAuthor: Anna Tuschling\nEditor: Michael Andreas\nEditor: Dawid Kasprowicz\nEditor: Stefan Rieger\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2018\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/1358\nAnthropophile Medien durchdringen zunehmend unsere lebensweltliche Realität, sei es im Ambient Assisted Living, als Pflegeassistenzsysteme, in den Arbeitsszenarien einer Industrie 4.0, als behagliche Interfaces des Affective Computing oder als Lifetracker der Quantified-Self-Bewegung. Verbunden ist damit der Einzug menschlicher Befindlichkeiten, Werte und sozialer Routinen in das Design medialer Agencies. Über 40 Jahre nach dem Erscheinen von Michel Foucaults “Surveiller et punir” gerät damit auch dessen Kritikbegriff ins Wanken. An die Stelle von “Überwachen und Strafen” tritt “Unterwachen und Schlafen”. Unterwachen und Schlafen stellt nicht das theoretische Programm einer vollautomatisierten Lebenswelt in Aussicht, sondern das Konstrukt einer nunmehr medialen Umsetzung anthropologischer Grundelemente wie Autonomie, Freiheit oder Vertrauen."

For scientific endeavors such as the detection of gravitational waves and the exploration of subatomic worlds, simulations are essential; however, the epistemic status of computer simulations is rather controversial as they are neither just theory nor just experiment. Therefore, computer simulations have challenged well-established insights and common scientific practices as well as our very understanding of knowledge. This volume contributes to the ongoing discussion on the epistemic position of computer simulations in a variety of physical disciplines, such as quantum optics, quantum mechanics, and computational physics. Originating from an interdisciplinary event, it shows that accounts of contemporary physics can constructively interfere with media theory, philosophy, and the history of science."

Day-to-day politics are largely driven by economic lobbies in the interest of what Habermas calls their „generalised particularism,“ the threat to take jobs and tax revenues elsewhere. Citizens’ influence over politicians is twofold: they are asked for their input in elections, referenda, online consultations and surveys, and citizens can initiate issues where they see political action needed. Yet these “participative forces,” including NGOs, street rallies and charities, regularly fail to reach the ears of elected politicians as effectively as those of well-funded corporate lobbies. Also, this type of voluntary engagement often falls short of presenting the kind of reasoned challenges to the incumbents—by the electorate—that Habermas’ communicative action aimed at. A more powerful model would therefore organise the efforts of the electorate in a way that both generates those reasoned arguments, which, as Habermas quite correctly pointed out differ from mere opinions, and delivers them to the elected politicians in a manner they can neither refuse nor ignore. This is what the Citizen Lobby intends to do."

Marx famously declared that philosophers had only interpreted the world, but the point was to change it. Heidegger on his part stressed that our modern malaise was due to the forgetting of being, for which he thought technological questions were central. Following from his study of Marx as a thinker of technology, and foreseeing debates about globalization, Axelos recognizes that technology now determines the world. Providing an introduction to some of his major themes, including the play of the world, Axelos asks if planetary technology requires a new, a future way of thought which in itself is planetary.\n\n\nLibrary Life: Werkstätten kulturwissenschaftlichen Forschens\n\nAuthor: Laura Meneghello\nAuthor: Friedolin Krentel\nAuthor: Anna Rebecca Hoffmann\nAuthor: Katja Barthel\nAuthor: Sebastian Brand\nAuthor: Alexander Friedrich\nAuthor: Jennifer Ch.

Based on the keynote lectures held at DiGRA2015, “Diversity of Play” provides a critical view on the current stage of digital games from a theoretic, artistic, and practical perspective by pointing towards the uncanny, the power of “unnatural” narratives, and the exceptions and uncertainties of digital ludic environments.

From flash-mobs in Taiwan to feminist mobilisations in India, from hybrid media strategies of Syrian activists to cultural protests in Thailand, we see the emergence of political acts that transform the citizen from being a beneficiary of change to becoming an agent of change. In co-shaping these changes, what the digital shall be used for, and what its consequences will be, are both up for speculation and negotiation. Digital Activism in Asia marks a particular shift where these questions are no longer being refracted through the ICT4D logic, or the West’s attempts to save Asia from itself, but shaped by multiplicity, unevenness, and urgencies of digital sites and users in Asia. This reader crowd-sources critical tools, concepts, analyses, and annotations, self-identified by a network of change makers in Asia as important in their own practices within their own contexts.\n\n\nLife and Technology: An Inquiry Into and Beyond Simondon\n\nAuthor: Jean-Hugues Barthélémy\nTranslator: Barnaby Norman\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/015\nThe philosophy of Gilbert Simondon has reinvigorated contemporary thinking about biological and technological beings. In this book, Jean-Hugues Barthélémy takes up Simondon’s thought and shows how life and technology are connected by a transversal theme: individuation. In the first essay, Barthélémy delivers a contemporary interpretation of Simondon’s concept of ontogenesis against the backdrop of biology and cybernetics. In the second essay, he extends his reflections to propose a non-anthropological understanding of technology, and so sets up a confrontation with the work of Martin Heidegger.\n\n\nThe Political Structure of UK Broadcasting 1949–1999\n\nAuthor: David Elstein\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/011\nIn 1999 David Elstein delivered a lecture series examining the evolvement of UK Broadcasting policy from 1949 to 1999. His sharp analysis is a valuable contribution to the post-war development of the British broadcasting system and unfolds many topical issues in current media policy debates."

As hero of the cyberpunk epic, in its brief but intense history, the cyborg has followed and anticipated the rapport and conflict between man and machine.\nIn the post-fordist era of digital networked media the cyborg unfolds itself in the dissemination of multiple bodies: on the Internet, in the shift of individual identity, in the new collective aggregation connected by software. It bridges virtuality and concreteness, possibility and necessity. The cyborg thus becomes a field of social conflict, one of the new figures in which the bio-political perspective is embodied.\n\n\nDie verschiedenen Modi der Existenz\n\nAuthor: Étienne Souriau\nTranslator: Thomas Wäckerle\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/003\n„Wäre die Philosophie auch nur eine Stunde der Mühe wert, wenn sie uns nicht für das Leben rüstete?“ Gezielten Schrittes entwirft der französische Philosoph Étienne Souriau in diesem dicht gedrängten Buch eine Grammatik der Existenz. Im Fokus steht nicht nur ihre Theorie, sondern auch die tatsächliche Ausübung der „Kunst des Existierens“. Wie Gilles Deleuze und William James vertritt Souriau dabei die These eines existenziellen Pluralismus: Es gibt Phänomene, Dinge, das Virtuelle, fiktionale Wesen – die Existenz ist polyphon. Souriaus radikale Herangehensweise hat auch Bruno Latour und Isabelle Stengers entscheidend beeinflusst. In ihrer ausführlichen Einleitung zu Souriaus Text von 1943 und dem ebenfalls zum ersten Mal in deutscher Sprache veröffentlichten Vortrag „Über den Modus der Existenz des zu vollbringenden Werks“ (1956) zeigt sich eindrucksvoll die Aktualität seines Denkens.\n\n\n30 Years After Les Immatériaux: Art, Science and Theory\n\nAuthor: Sven-Olov Wallenstein\nAuthor: Anne Elisabeth Sejten\nAuthor: Bernard Stiegler\nAuthor: Jean-Louis Boissier\nAuthor: Daniel Birnbaum\nAuthor: Thierry Dufrêne\nAuthor: Francesca Gallo\nAuthor: Charlie Gere\nAuthor: Antony Hudek\nAuthor: Jean-François Lyotard\nAuthor: Robin Mackay\nEditor: Yuk Hui\nEditor: Andreas Broeckmann\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/002\nIn 1985, the French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard curated a groundbreaking exhibition called Les Immatériaux at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The exhibition showed how telecommunication technologies were beginning to impact every aspect of life. At the same time, it was a material demonstration of what Lyotard called the post-modern condition. This book features a previously unpublished report by Jean-François Lyotard on the conception of Les Immatériaux and its relation to postmodernity. Reviewing the historical significance of the exhibition, his text is accompanied by twelve contemporary meditations. The philosophers, art historians, and artists analyse this important moment in the history of media and theory, and reflect on the new material conditions brought about by digital technologies in the last 30 years.\n\n\nThe Politics of Micro-Decisions: Edward Snowden, Net Neutrality, and the Architectures of the Internet\n\nAuthor: Florian Sprenger\nTranslator: Valentine A. Pakis\nForeword by: Christopher Kelty\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/005\nBe it in the case of opening a website, sending an email, or high-frequency trading, bits and bytes of information have to cross numerous nodes at which micro-decisions are made. These decisions concern the most efficient path through the network, the processing speed, or the priority of incoming data packets.\nDespite their multifaceted nature, micro-decisions are a dimension of control and surveillance in the twenty-first century that has received little critical attention. They represent the smallest unit and the technical precondition of a contemporary network politics – and of our potential opposition to it. The current debates regarding net neutrality and Edward Snowden’s revelation of NSA surveillance are only the tip of the iceberg. What is at stake is nothing less than the future of the Internet as we know it.\n\n\nPolitik der Mikroentscheidungen: Edward Snowden, Netzneutralität und die Architekturen des Internets\n\nAuthor: Florian Sprenger\nForeword by: Christopher Kelty\nLüneburg: meson press eG, 2015\nhttps://doi.org/10.14619/004\nOb beim Aufrufen einer Webseite, beim Versenden einer E-Mail oder beim Hochfrequenzhandel an der Börse: Auf ihrem Weg durch die Weiten digitaler Netze durchqueren Bits zahlreiche Knoten, an denen eine Reihe von Mikroentscheidungen getroffen werden. Diese Entscheidungen betreffen den besten Pfad zum Ziel, die Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit oder die Priorität zwischen den ankommenden Paketen.\nIn ihrer vielschichtigen Gestalt bilden solche Mikroentscheidungen eine bislang nur marginal beachtete Dimension von Kontrolle und Überwachung im 21. Jahrhundert. Sie sind sowohl die kleinste Einheit als auch die technische Voraussetzung einer gegenwärtigen Politik digitaler Netzwerke – und des Widerstands gegen sie. Die aktuellen Debatten um Netzneutralität und Edward Snowdens Enthüllung der NSA-Überwachung bilden dabei lediglich die Spitze des Eisbergs. Auf dem Spiel steht nicht weniger als die Zukunft des Internets, wie wir es kennen."

Pollution, the poison of pesticides, the exhaustion of natural resources, falling water tables, growing social inequalities – these are all problems that can no longer be treated separately. The effects of global warming have a cumulative impact, and it is not a matter of a crisis that will “pass” before everything goes back to “normal.”\nOur governments are totally incapable of dealing with the situation. Economic warfare obliges them to stick to the goal of irresponsible, even criminal, economic growth, whatever the cost. It is no surprise that people were so struck by the catastrophe in New Orleans. The response of the authorities – to abandon the poor whilst the rich were able to take shelter – is a symbol of the coming barbarism."

It describes the permeation of economic, political, and social contexts by game-elements such as awards, rule structures, and interfaces that are inspired by video games. Sometimes the term is reduced to the implementation of points, badges, and leaderboards as incentives and motivations to be productive. Sometimes it is envisioned as a universal remedy to deeply transform society toward more humane and playful ends. Despite its use by corporations to manage brand communities and personnel, however, gamification is more than just a marketing buzzword. States are beginning to use it as a new tool for governing populations more effectively. It promises to fix what is wrong with reality by making every single one of us fitter, happier, and healthier. Indeed, it seems like all of society is up for being transformed into one massive game.\nThe contributions in this book offer a candid assessment of the gamification hype. They trace back the historical roots of the phenomenon and explore novel design practices and methods. They critically discuss its social implications and even present artistic tactics for resistance. It is time to rethink gamification!"

John Isbell provides an essential collection that illuminates the impact women writers had on French literature and politics during a time marked by three revolutions, the influx of Romantic art, and rapid technological change.\n\n\nBreaking Conventions: Five Couples in Search of Marriage-Career Balance at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century\n\nAuthor: Patricia Auspos\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0318\nThis rich history illuminates the lives and partnerships of five married couples – two British, three American – whose unions defied the conventions of their time and anticipated social changes that were to come in the ensuing century. In all five marriages, both husband and wife enjoyed thriving professional lives: a shocking circumstance at a time when wealthy white married women were not supposed to have careers, and career women were not supposed to marry.\n\n\nFolktales of Mayotte, an African Island\n\nAuthor: Lee Haring\nForeword by: Mark Turin\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0315\nThe book uncovers the versatility and literary skills of oral narrators in a small African island. Relying on the researches of three French ethnographers who interviewed storytellers in the 1970s-80s, Lee Haring shows a once-colonised people using verbal art to preserve ancient values in the postcolonial world, when the island of Mayotte was transforming itself from a neglected colony to an overseas department of France.\n\n\nHaving Too Much: Philosophical Essays on Limitarianism\n\nEditor: Ingrid Robeyns\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0338\nHaving Too Much is the first academic volume devoted to limitarianism: the idea that the use of economic or ecosystem resources should not exceed certain limits. This concept has deep roots in economic and political thought. One can find similar statements of such limits in thinkers such as Plato, Aquinas, and Spinoza. But Having Too Much is the first time in contemporary political philosophy that limitarianism is explored at length and in detail.\n\n\nFrom Handwriting to Footprinting: Text and Heritage in the Age of Climate Crisis\n\nAuthor: Anne Baillot\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0355\nIntegrating historical, archival and environmental perspectives, From Handwriting to Footprinting illuminates the impact that digitisation has had on the dissemination and preservation of textual heritage and reflects on what its future may hold. It is invaluable reading for anyone interested in textual history from a linguistic or philological perspective, as well as those working on publishing, archival and infrastructure projects that require the storing and long-term preservation of texts, or who want to know how to develop a more mindful attachment to digitised material."

Whilst twentieth-century scholars spoke about the adaptation of Arabic metrics to Hebrew, he instead approaches these compositions by Andalusi Jews (10th-13th c.) as Arabic metrics written in Hebrew, thus emphasising how Hebrew poetry of the Andalusi Jews can help us to understand the general evolution of Arabic strophic poetry, and its experimental evolution, which is quite unlike classical and strophic Arabic poetry.\n\n\nThe Last Man Who Knew Everything: Thomas Young\n\nAuthor: Andrew Robinson\nForeword by: Martin Rees\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0344\nNo one has given the polymath Thomas Young (1773-1829) the all-round examination he so richly deserves—until now.

As well as ethical, their role is conceptual: they can improve the quality and coherence of scientific research by ensuring that particular concepts are used consistently and thoughtfully across interdisciplinary projects. Hens argues that chance and uncertainty play a central part in bioethics, but that these qualities can be in tension with the attempt to establish a given theory as scientific knowledge: in describing organisms and practices, in a sense we create the world. Hens contends that this is necessarily an ethical activity.\n\n\nLandscapes of Investigation: Contributions to Critical Mathematics Education\n\nEditor: Miriam Godoy Penteado\nEditor: Ole Skovsmose\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0316\nCreating landscapes of investigation is a primary concern of critical mathematics education. It enables us to organise educational processes so that students and teachers are able to get involved in explorations guided by dialogical interactions. It attempts to address explicit or implicit forms of social injustice by means of mathematics, and also to promote a critical conception of mathematics, challenging the assumption that the subject represents objectivity and neutrality. Landscapes of Investigation provides many illustrations of how this can be done in primary, secondary, and university education. It also illustrates how exploring landscapes of investigation can contribute to mathematics teacher education programmes.\n\n\nGreening Europe: 2022 European Public Investment Outlook\n\nEditor: Floriana Cerniglia\nEditor: Francesco Saraceno\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0328\nThe third installment of the ‘European Public Investment Outlook’ series is an important and timely publication that draws together recent analyses to recommend significant increases in public investment in green ventures. Compelling data from key economists affiliated with international organizations like the International Monetary Fund, European Investment Bank and the European Commission, as well as academic departments and policy institutes are a clarion call for green investment to boost the economy and put the planet on a sustainable path.\n\n\nMusic in Evolution and Evolution in Music\n\nAuthor: Steven Jan\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0301\nMusic in Evolution and Evolution in Music by Steven Jan is a comprehensive account of the relationships between evolutionary theory and music. Examining the ‘evolutionary algorithm’ that drives biological and musical-cultural evolution, the book provides a distinctive commentary on how musicality and music can shed light on our understanding of Darwin’s famous theory – and vice-versa.\n\n\nTransforming Conservation: A Practical Guide to Evidence and Decision Making\n\nEditor: William J. Sutherland\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0321\nThere are severe problems with the decision-making processes currently widely used, leading to ineffective use of evidence, faulty decisions, wasting of resources and the erosion of public and political support. In this book an international team of experts provide solutions.\n\n\nWilliam Rimmer: Champion of Imagination in American Art\n\nAuthor: Dorinda Evans\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0304\nWilliam Rimmer (1816–1879) is arguably the first modernist American sculptor, although his inventive originality has not been fully acknowledged. Rimmer cultivated an art of ideas and personal expression whilst supporting himself as a physician and, later, as a teacher of art anatomy at the Cooper Union School of Design for Women in New York."

Marcel Cobussen intertwines sonic studies with philosophy, sound art, sociology and more to create an impressively lucid and innovative guide to sonic materialism, calling for a re-sensitization to our acoustic environment and arguing that everyday sounds have (micro)political, social, and ethical impact to which we should attend.\n\n\nThe Bible in the Bowls: A Catalogue of Biblical Quotations in Published Jewish Babylonian Aramaic Magic Bowls\n\nAuthor: Daniel James Waller\nContributions by: Dorota Molin\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0305\nThe Bible in the Bowls represents a complete catalogue of Hebrew Bible quotations found in the published corpus of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic magic bowls. As our only direct epigraphic witnesses to the Hebrew Bible from late antique Babylonia, the bowls are uniquely placed to contribute to research on the (oral) transmission of the biblical text in late antiquity; the pre-Masoretic Babylonian vocalisation tradition; the formation of the liturgy and the early development of the Jewish prayer book; the social locations of biblical knowledge in late antique Babylonia and socio-religious typologies of the bowls; and the dynamics of scriptural citation in ancient Jewish magic.\n\n\nWomen and Migration(s) II\n\nEditor: Cheryl Finley\nEditor: Ellyn Toscano\nEditor: Deborah Willis\nEditor: Kalia Brooks\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0296\nWomen and Migration(s) II draws together contributions from scholars and artists showcasing the breadth of intersectional experiences of migration, from diaspora to internal displacement. Building on conversations initiated in Women and Migration: Responses in Art and History, this edited volume features a range of written styles, from memoir to artists’ statements to journalistic and critical essays. The collection shows how women’s experiences of migration have been articulated through art, film, poetry and even food.\n\n\nStudies in the Masoretic Tradition of the Hebrew Bible\n\nEditor: Daniel J. Crowther\nEditor: Aaron D. Hornkohl\nEditor: Geoffrey Khan\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0330\nThis volume brings together papers on topics relating to the transmission of the Hebrew Bible from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern period. We refer to this broadly in the title of the volume as the ‘Masoretic Tradition’. The papers are innovative studies of a range of aspects of this Masoretic tradition at various periods, many of them presenting hitherto unstudied primary sources."

It is the story of their personal and collective values, their mistakes, and the challenges they faced, and it will resonate with anyone who has tried to organize and work with a group of very different people.\n\n\nDiachronic Variation in the Omani Arabic Vernacular of the Al-ʿAwābī District: From Carl Reinhardt (1894) to the Present Day\n\nAuthor: Roberta Morano\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0298\nIn this monograph, Roberta Morano re-examines one of the foundational works of the Omani Arabic dialectology field, Carl Reinhardt’s Ein arabischer Dialekt gesprochen in ’Oman und Zanzibar (1894). This German-authored work was prolific in shaping our knowledge of Omani Arabic during the twentieth century, until the 1980s when more recent linguistic studies on the Arabic varieties spoken in Oman began to appear.\n\n\nLife, Re-Scaled: The Biological Imagination in Twenty-First-Century Literature and Performance\n\nEditor: Liliane Campos\nEditor: Pierre-Louis Patoine\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0303\nThis edited volume explores new engagements with the life sciences in contemporary fiction, poetry, comics and performance. The gathered case studies investigate how recent creative work reframes the human within microscopic or macroscopic scales, from cellular biology to systems ecology, and engages with the ethical, philosophical, and political issues raised by the twenty-first century’s shifting views of life. The collection thus examines literature and performance as spaces that shape our contemporary biological imagination.\n\n\nThe Official Indonesian Qurʾān Translation: The History and Politics of Al-Qur’an dan Terjemahnya\n\nAuthor: Fadhli Lukman\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0289\nThis book studies the political and institutional project of Al-Qur’an dan Terjemahnya, the official translation of the Qurʾān into Indonesian by the Indonesian government. It investigates how the translation was produced and presented, and how it is read, as well as considering the implications of the state’s involvement in such a work."

In a synthesis of ideas from several disciplines, solutions are detected in misaligned incentives, distorted financial engineering and information asymmetry. By revealing how weaknesses at multiple points can interact and cumulate to produce inefficient outcomes, the discussion serves as a corrective to the overwhelmingly positive tone of most commentary on M&A, whilst also advocating changes in participants’ contracts, in taxation, and in regulation which could significantly reduce the number of mergers that fail."

The second identifies key domains where European public investment is needed to build a more sustainable Europe, from climate change to human capital formation.\n\n\nEpidicus by Plautus: An Annotated Latin Text, with a Prose Translation\n\nAuthor: Catherine Tracy\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0269\nEpidicus, a light-hearted comedy by Plautus about the machinations of a trickster slave and the inadequacies of his bumbling masters, appears here in both its original Latin and a sparkling new translation by Catherine Tracy. Epidicus, the cunning slave, is charged with finding his master’s illegitimate daughter and the secret girlfriend of his master’s son, but a comedy of mistaken identities and competing interests ensues. Amid the mayhem, Epidicus aims to win his freedom whilst risking some of the grislier punishments the Romans inflicted on their unfortunate slaves.\n\n\nDocumentary Making for Digital Humanists\n\nAuthor: Darren R. Reid\nAuthor: Brett Sanders\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0255\nDocumentary Making for Digital Humanists sets out the fundamentals of filmmaking, explores academic discourse on digital documentaries and online distribution, and considers the place of this discourse in the evolving academic landscape.\n\n\nForms of Life and Subjectivity: Rethinking Sartre’s Philosophy\n\nAuthor: Daniel Rueda Garrido\nCambridge, UK: Open Book Publishers, 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0259\n‘Forms of Life and Subjectivity: Rethinking Sartre’s Philosophy’ explores the fundamental question of why we act as we do. Informed by an ontological and phenomenological approach, and building mainly, but not exclusively, on the thought of Sartre, Daniel Rueda Garrido considers the concept of a “form of life” as a term that bridges the gap between subjective identity and communities."

From lithographs and engraved reproductions of paintings to daguerreotypes, stereoscopic views, and mass-produced sculptures, works of visual art became available in a wider range of media than ever before. But the circulation and reproduction of artworks also raised new questions about the legal rights of painters, sculptors, engravers, photographers, architects, collectors, publishers, and subjects of representation (such as sitters in paintings or photographs). Copyright and patent laws tussled with informal cultural norms and business strategies as individuals and groups attempted to exert some degree of control over these visual creations."

Reversing established critical approaches to the canon and literary influence, its contributors ask us to consider how reading against linear chronologies can elicit fascinating new patterns and perspectives.\n\n\nTechnology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject: A Posthuman Approach\n\nAuthor: Richard S.
