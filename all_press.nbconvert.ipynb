      "This book is a compelling blend of mystery, history, and creative non-fiction, that brings to life the wartime story of Norah Hodgkinson (1925-2009), a working-class schoolgirl, later clerical worker, and a prolific diarist. The book opens with a sailor’s letter of thanks for a pair of socks that Norah had knitted for the Royal Navy Comforts Fund in 1940―a gift that led to an exciting romance with the sailor’s dashing airman brother. But as the author pieces together Norah’s diary entries and the sailor’s letters, questions emerge about the men’s identities and intentions. 'A Place of Dreams' uncovers a dark tale of male rivalry and wartime anonymity, and a young woman’s appetite for life and love amidst unexpected dangers.\n",

His Ephemerides, spanning 1634 to 1660, and his extensive correspondence with leading thinkers across Britain and Protestant Europe offer an unparalleled window into the era’s religious, political, and scientific ferment.\n",

The means of written transmission and the textualisation of the oral reading of these scriptures exhibit many parallels, which reflect cultural contact and convergence across the various religious communities. This volume is the outcome of a project, funded jointly by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Arts and Humanities Research Council, that aimed to bring together strands of research related to various aspects of the transmission of these sacred texts in order to reach a deeper understanding of the intertwined world of the three major religions of the Middle East at their formative periods of development during the early Islamic centuries.\n",

Intertwined with colonialism, racism and sexism, concepts of property have found an echo in piracy and “postcolonial copyright.” At the level of theory, a crossing out and a reversal of time are required to undo property-related violence and its mind­sets. At the level of artistic practice new modes of appropriation become imaginable. And while the commons will not be restored, multiple modes of having and commoning are possible.\n",

      "This book explores the acoustic agency of brass as a vital medium through which histories of extraction, resistance, and collective creativity resonate. Blending metalwork, experimental instrument-building, and philosophical inquiry, the book listens closely to brass not just as material, but as storyteller—what the author calls hylo narrans, echoing Sylvia Wynter’s invocation of homo narrans. Grounded in their practice spanning artisanal craftsmanship and industrial labor, the author examines how materials respond, resist, and reshape meaning within the workshop, the concert hall, and the broader social fabric. By introducing chimeracords—hybrid sound objects forged from factory detritus—and their affordance for sonic experimentation, Hylo Narrans challenges Western narratives of purity, utility, and control, inviting readers to consider alternative storylines posed by materials-in-flight.\n",

      "This volume offers a fresh and modern introduction to one of abstract algebra’s key topics. Guiding readers through the transition between structure theory and representation theory, this textbook explores how algebraic objects like groups and rings act as symmetries of other structures. Using the accessible yet powerful language of category theory, the book reimagines standard approaches to topics such as modules and algebras in a way that unlocks modern treatments of more advanced topics such as quiver representations and even representations of Hopf algebras and categories.\n",

Emerging in the 1980s during a period of cultural revival in Tibetan communities, khashag fused traditional Tibetan expression with influences from Han Chinese xiangsheng (crosstalk), evolving into a medium of sharp societal critique and joyous entertainment. Menla Jyab, a pioneering performer, used his platform in radio, television, to craft comedies described as ‘having meaning in every line’.\n",

Of the 358 known editions printed in 1501, only a few contained formal music notation or specialist theory. Yet a surprising wealth of musical knowledge emerges from religious texts, classical commentaries, lifestyle guides, poetry, and more. These sources—rarely penned by professional musicians—reflect the broader cultural presence of music in early 16th-century life, touching on themes like music’s moral influence, its role in education, and its scientific understanding.\n",

In this groundbreaking book, Mukesh Eswaran confronts these urgent questions through the lens of economics, focusing deeply on an underexplored aspect: the erosion of Indigenous culture. While empirical studies have shed some light on Indigenous struggles, Eswaran argues that mainstream economic theory fails to grasp the unique realities of Indigenous communities. His work introduces innovative models that incorporate cultural and communal values—particularly the sacredness of land and the importance of extended family and communal life—as foundational components of Indigenous well-being.\n",

      "In the sweltering heat of 1381, England's feudal foundations trembled as the Peasants' Revolt erupted—a rebellion that would forever echo through history. Triggered by an oppressive poll tax but fuelled by deeper injustices, this uprising saw land workers, artisans, and commoners rise to challenge the authority of landowners, church, and crown. 'When Katherine Brewed' brings this momentous event to life on stage, blending historical fidelity with a bold, radical perspective.\n",

      "Seit Anfang der 2010er Jahre beschäftigt sich das Affective Computing mit der Entwicklung von digitalen Technologien zur automatischen Erfassung menschlicher Gefühle. Das sogenannte emotion detection operiert auf Grundlage des Facial Action Coding System (FACS), einem Klassifikationssystem für Emotionen, das verspricht, Gefühle anhand der Bewegung der Gesichtsmuskeln zu entschlüsseln. Das FACS transportiert jedoch ein Gefühlsparadigma, das ungelöste Probleme aus der Vorgeschichte der Emotionsforschung bündelt. Gefühle Vermessen untersucht das Nachwirken dieser Probleme in der computergestützten Depressionsforschung und Autismustherapie, welche die Verfahren des Affective Computing anwenden. Im Zentrum steht die Frage, warum das Codierungssystem trotz dieser Ambivalenzen eine mächtige Produktivität entfaltet.\n",

From early twentieth-century critics like Ahad Ha’am and Hannah Arendt to contemporary scholars, rabbis, journalists, and activists, the voices gathered here challenge the dominant narratives that conflate Judaism with Zionism.\n",

Through diverse methodologies—archival research, social media ethnography, and textual analysis—the essays investigate the global movements of film and video formats, the platformization of cultural industries, and the evolving nature of media consumption.

With a focus on how Islamic texts have been shaped by state policies, ideological shifts, and religious identities, it traces connections between these regions and the wider world, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and China. This volume draws on perspectives from both Sunni and Shia traditions, as well as contributions by non-Muslim scholars. Through archival research and close textual analysis, the contributors demonstrate how translations of the Qur’an have served not only as religious texts but also as reflections of profound transformations in national and religious identities in communist and post-communist societies.\n",

In digital spaces, hate speech is increasingly conveyed through memes, images, and videos, blending textual and pictorial elements to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and other exclusionary narratives. While historical perspectives on hate imagery are well-documented, this collection emphasises the pressing need for contemporary analysis of visual and multimodal communication in digital environments.\n",

This book deals with the task of bearing witness to anguish, atrocity, and madness, as these are staged in the tragic theatre. Focusing on the relationship between the protagonist and the onlooker or witness, it explores how the tragic figure, often and understandably viewed as alien or culpable or profoundly strange, struggles to be understood. Centred on Shakespeare, its wide-ranging approach also introduces works by (among others) the Greeks, Racine, Ibsen, Pirandello, Kafka, Beckett, and Kane.\n",

The recent resurgence of scholarship and productions evidences that, as a deafened woman and Irish playwright, Deevy’s creative power continues to disrupt and tilt the canon of Irish drama, theatre, and performance.\n",

      "The shift back from quasi monochrome to coloured motion picture during the 1950s and 1960s famously provided moviegoers the dazzling opportunity to more fully engage their senses, all the while opening new modes of affective possibilities for filmmakers. Set against the intersection of media studies, emotion theory, biology, and digital humanities, Feeling Colour: Chromatic Embodiment in Film Culture (1950s-1960s) delves into the role colour played in the oft-fraught relationship between cinema and its audiences. This transnational analysis of an extensive range of midcentury cinematography examines the multilayered effects which extend beyond the silver screen, offering a high-level theoretical elaboration and in-depth historical exploration of both experimental and mainstream movies.\n",

      "Broeckmann’s book provides the first comprehensive account of the preparation of this epochal event. It shows how the exhibition resulted from multiple, collaborative and interdisciplinary trajectories in such diverse fields as contemporary art, architecture, science, and network media. Based on extensive archival research, The Making of Les Immatériaux offers detailed insights into the curatorial process. Throughout its ten chapters, the book highlights the different forms of cooperation among the people involved in the conception of the exhibition, including Lyotard, Chaput, the team at the Centre de Création Industrielle, and their consultations with artists, theorists, and scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les Immatériaux marks a pivotal point in the history of exhibitions in the 20th century because it gave important impulses for the organisation, design and structure of interdisciplinary exhibitions. Broeckmann discusses the place of Les Immatériaux in the broader context of this history, examining the epistemology of exhibits, curatorial agency, and interdisciplinarity in research networks. The book takes up current questions about the relationship between materiality and immateriality, between subjectivity and thinghood, and shows how Les Immatériaux continues to offer a significant contribution to debates that over the last decades have become ever more urgent.\n",

This structure of awareness then forms the basis for identifying differences in the experienced meaning of phenomena, and how awareness needs to change to allow new meanings to emerge—whether educationally, historically, culturally or socially.\n",

      "Academia and its citizens, during periods of political violence and social conflict, are often overlooked. When attention is given, the focus tends to be on student activism, access to higher education, or curriculum development. The experiences of academics affected by conflict remain under-researched, despite the crucial role they play as educators and in generating, documenting, preserving and challenging knowledges. This is particularly concerning given that academics have−and continue to be−at risk as targets of sanction, persecution and oppression.\n",

Und welches Widerstandspotenzial entfalten diese künstlerischen Praktiken gegen die Paradigmen des (Neo-)Extraktivismus? Die Beiträge in Kritik des Neo-Extraktivismus in der Gegenwartskunst analysieren die künstlerische Auseinandersetzung mit unterschiedlichen extraktivistischen Phänomenen aus kunstwissenschaftlichen, kuratorischen und künstlerischen Perspektiven. Eröffnet wird ein globaler Blickwinkel, der kritisch die Materialitäten und Infrastrukturen des (Neo-)Extraktivismus beleuchtet und um dekoloniale Perspektiven ergänzt.\n",

Im Zentrum steht die Spannung zwischen Fluchtauftritt und Evidenzprozess, das Wechselspiel von ästhetischen Strategien und rhetorischen Wirksamkeiten, von Situiertheit und Infrastrukturen.
